1,"All this place does is double the price of Amazon products. I use the shop app which tells me who fulfils the order and yep, I can see that it ships straight from Amazon. I went onto amazon and searched and found the exact same jackets that I ordered from Angel Jackets but for HALF the price that Angel Jackets is selling them for. And on top of that, Angel Jackets charges a restocking fee - which Amazon does not! And you also have to pay return shipping. I really wish I had noticed this before ordering from Angel Jackets. I feel so ripped off right now."
2,"The jacket purchased for my husband fits perfectly, couldn’t be happier and I do intend to be a repeat customer. Highly recommend Angel Jackets. Customer service was spot on as we were asked if we were purchasing the correct size .. we were and we did!!"
3,"I received my order from Angel Jackets and have to say I was totally happy with my purchase. The quality and craftsmanship of my jacket is excellent. Soft, comfortable,  well made and at a very fair price. I’ll definitely buy again from this retailer."
4,"I'm a new customer but am so impressed with the service and quality of the products sold, l have bought 3 jackets in the last few months. Whatever issues may arise, Angeljackets resolve them in an efficient and timely manner."
5,"It is greatI ordered a leather jacked. I ordered a large, then I received an email asking me to take some measurements before I placed my order. I took thosemeasurements and then ordered an extra large. It fit perfectly when I got it. Thanks for the extra email."
6,"I am so excited about my new leather jacket! The style and fit are exactly as described. I considered ordering a size up, based on a few reviews, but was glad that I did not as it fits true to size. There was an unpleasant odour when I first unpacked it, but after a few hours it had aired out and now smells like fresh leather. I love it!"
7,"I am wowed by the value of my jacket. The attractive yet suspiciously low price had me questioning the jacket’s quality.but after studying Angel Jacket’s return policy and following their detailed sizing guide, I was reassured that ordering this jacket online was not risky. I am ecstatic with my purchase. The fit and the soft quality leather satisfies me 100%. This was a five star purchase."
8,"I did a search for a leather jacket. After spending some time searching, I was taken by the look and styles of the jackets sold by this company. I found what I was looking for and was lucky that they had a promotion to go with it. The follow up emails were prompt and informative. The shipping was quick and free. Upon receiving my jacket, I was pleasantly surprised that the quality was excellent, and the color as shown in the ad. I highly recommend you take a look at their site."
9,"I tried to purchase a leather Jacket (UK) via paypal -3 Inst. Then I received a message saying that the purchase will be complete once the whole amount is received (which is going to be three months later when it won't be needed anymore). I have tried to contact the customer care twice to cancel the order as Paypal suggested. No response. I don't know the quality of the jackets, but your customer care doesn't match the quality to satisfy a customer. Customer care should not be provided only if you purchase something. For sure you have lost one even before I buy anything."
10,"Have to admit I was a little wary of ordering from Angel Jackets, as was unfamiliar with the company... but SO glad I did! The entire experience was easy, my orders (I made two separate ones because I was so pleased with my original order) were delivered quickly. The jackets I received were beautiful- the quality is top notch, the attention to detail is great. The sizing chart is accurate. I couldn't be happier with every aspect of dealing with Angel Jackets. Highly recommend."
11,"Awesome blazer! Received a lot of compliments on it. Nice fit, beautiful black color, thick yet soft leather, totally clean, no odors, and came with original tags, great piece. Had some delays with shipping my order, but this doesn't seem to be representative of their usual service. The customer support team responds quickly. Overall, I highly recommend it :)"
12,"I really like this jacket. Fits snug,but that is what I wanted, I ordered a medium and it fits good. The jacket needs to get broken in. However, once that happens this will be an excellent jacket I give it 5 out of 5 star"
13,"I totally loved the style of my jacket and the feel of the leather!So Fashionable and sophisticated, yet light in weight. I couldn't resist getting one for my husband, he received it yesterday and he is sooo thrilled about it, perfect fit and sits well on his 6ft + frame!"
14,"Delivery was quick for me, had no issues there. Ordered the wrong size but they have been very helpful with the exchange process. The quality of the jacket felt high standard."
15,A trustworthy company with quality merchandise. Keeps you informed and delivers fast. I am very happy with my purchase.
16,Good quality jacket true to size. Kept informed from order to delivery and arrived in good time.Lovely jacket have had lots of compliments. Would recommend.
17,"Best customer service, super fast post, value for money Tuxedo, I ordered the wrong size pants, they bent over backwards for me to help. They sent a second pair, faster post than the first. This has been the best experience of have had with a web based company in many years. Highly recommend them as a AAA+++ business."
18,Excellent communication and service. Jacket arrived within 5 days of international order. High quality; couldn't be more pleased
19,I ordered a cognac brown jacket and it has just arrived. I can honestly say I was nervous opening it because I thought it was going to be too good to be true!!! The customer service has been brilliant from day one and it has reached me in a really timely manner as well. The jacket is a gorgeous waxy brown cognac colour and seems to be very well finished. It is slightly thinner (and therefore lighter) than a cow leather jacket I own but this is lambskin which will be perfect for spring and autumn. I am honestly stoked! Also pls follow the measurements online. They’re pretty spot on.5 stars guys. Now I only wish you had some other colours like deep inky blues and greens.
20,"I highly recommend this company. My jacket is beautiful, well made and a great price. The good were shipped straight away and arrived promptly. I’m so happy with my purchase!"
21,Great products!Great price!Great service!Great online and product return policy!...and that's from a Man United Fan buying in the old enemy territory!
22,Amazing service!!Quick response really catered to my needs beautiful pieces went out of their way to help me.Definately will be a customer again!G x
23,"Shoes came very fast and was in great condition, just discovered the shop too looking for some designer sale and Common Projects!"
24,"I love their products, they are beautiful, fast delivery and comfortable to wear"
25,"I've shopped online with Union22 several times over the years.  Even for online, you get a very personal service, quick email comms and handwritten thank you notes added to your package, for example. They also have one of the best collections of brands in the country. Would love to visit the shop one of these days! Highly recommended!"
26,Great store for mens clothes and the latest sunglasses with exceptional service from Dale. International delivery to UAE took 2 days 👌
27,Shipment was very quick and quality of clothes are extraordinary.I had tiny issue but they fixed it quickly and the communication with Dale was very smooth.Will visit the store to thank you when I have a chance!
28,The whole shopping experience from choosing the items to delivery was very efficient and professional. The items are as advertised and excellent quality. I would highly recommend this retailer
29,Best quality and the whole process from buying to shipping was sooo fast😊😊
30,Excellent service great quality clothes fast delivery and packaged with a touch of luxury.
31,Good information and pictures of the trainers. Shipping was fast. That's why I'm a regular shopper from Union22.
32,Been buying all my clothes from Dale for over 5 years now He’s the most honest guy I know and nothings to much trouble he goes the extra mile for his customers he’s a true gent and has a good eye for up and coming trends and fashion houses check this guy out he’s the business 😃👍
33,Every time I use Union22 I’m blown away. The combination of incredibly low prices and a truly personal service is for me the best online shopping experience out there. I love the fact that they are a small business and that they are clear about their terms: both aspects make me really trust them.
34,"High quality, perfect garments at a very competitive price. Quick, efficient service. Thank you"
35,Received my order withinTwo days after the order was placed ..I have been ordering from Union 22for four years and never been dissatisfied they are very professional and always go to there website first to make a purchase .The item came wonderfully wrapped .5* is not enough for this review ..Raj
36,Very good service from these guys. Have used them before and will shop there again. Some fine clothes on sale as well.
37,Picked up a bargain in the sale. Dale discovered the size was out of stock but he did a solid by contacting the designer and getting hold of the size I ordered. Don’t know of any other retailer who would do this! 10/10.
38,"Usually shop Hugo Boss, Reiss etc but I feel the quality from these mid range designer outlets as dipped, it's took a while to find a company that sells quality with a great attitude to customer care and service, finally found Union 22.My first order was a pair of Tramarossa jeans pricey at £275 (normally would pay up to £150 for jeans) but the quality and fit was there to see, and hopefully they will stand the test of time."
39,"It has been a great pleasure to purchase from Union 22 with the very personal touch of Mr Dale Allman who replies immediately through an email. and even goes out of his way  to search for items from Sweden. We have purchased a lot in the past and will continue to do so even if the items are not in his website anymore.  THANK YOU MR DALE ALMAN!  WITH ALL THE BEST WISHES FROM Perth, Western Australia.. WE HOPE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON SOON JUST TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE AND CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU. > Rose of Oz."
40,"I like looking dapper and stylish actually. I always strive to gather sights from the mass when I am going somewhere or just walking around the town. I dunno know, mb these are traits of a true narcissist but it doesn't really matter for me. What matters is that this company offers a huge collection of various suits, costumes, shirts, tee's, sweatshirts and hoodies. I always buy here the attire as I want to look fresh nearly daily. I am quite  a smart man and I sold my old clothes and buy a new one. It's so kind of shopaholism =) So, I would highly recommend this store for all the men who want to look gorgeous and handsome."
41,"The order confirmation email was sent right after the order was placed. A shipping notification email with a tracking link was sent to me when the package was shipped out. Properly packaged with a paper wrap, bubble wraps, and my receipt with a handwritten note. My package was delivered by UPS. The package was received within 7 days and was delayed over a weekend due to weather conditions which is understandable. The product was as described and photographed on their website. I didn't need to return anything, thus can't commend their return process. Overall, a nice shopping experience, and I will shop with A.K. Rikk's again."
42,"The site is very good, they made my dream come true - I bought myself a new computer. They have profitable mining, fast payouts and other benefits. Reliable company, you can trust them, have a company certificate, responsive support, etc. Made $3,000 from this site in 12 months.  Environmental company using alternative energy. All the best of great income and health!"
43,"As always A.K. Rikks goes above and beyond! Whether ordering online or shopping in the store, the staff exemplifies all the best traits that go into great customer service.  Once you shop here you become a part of the ""tribe"".  Great selection from a variety of brands that are not found elsewhere in Grand Rapids. Thank you!"
44,"AK Rikks has some of the best if not THE best customer service I’ve ever experienced anywhere.  When the sale promo code did not work for me because the sale had just ended, AK Rikks texted me my own personal code and they honored the sale price and they couldn’t have been nicer and more friendly.  I got my package in two days with a little personalized note on the receipt.  It was a nice touch.  I really can’t recommend this place enough.  Greg"
45,"Website was spot on when ordering, item shipped faster then expected. Packaging was great & item was just as described. First time purchasing with you & look forward to again. Thank u :)"
46,"I like buying clothes. Every season I got to the mall or clothing store in order to buy new clothes for the new season. I prefer wearing t's, trousers or jeans and I have plenty of shoe pairs. However, recently, unfortunately, my favorite clothing store was closed because of the restrictions accepted due to coronavirus, I started to search for another clothign store, where I could uy new clothes. Fortunately, I found this comapny and after I explored the assortment presented here I ordered couple of t's and a sweatshirt. Everything was delivered in time and I am glad that I applied here."
47,I had  such an excellent experience with A.K.Ricks. I made a purchase but unfortunately it was out of stock. I was contacted immediately and reassured that the item would be sent to as soon as it is available. A few week later I received my item in one of the best packaging I have ever seen. I recommend this store 100%.
48,"I have never experienced a more attentive ""online"" store. The people at AK Rikk's are exceptional with their customer service, and the product selection is outstanding. I will definitely continue to shop this store, despite being almost a thousand miles away."
49,"Shoes came very fast and was in great condition, just discovered the shop too looking for some designer sale and Common Projects!"
50,Love your store! Got my husband a beautiful wool coat from your 90% off sale. It was on my doorstep two days later! Fast and great service!
51,"It was myfirst purchase on this website. The shipping was very fast and the communication was great. Unfortunately I live in France so the shipping was more complicated and long but the seller offer a great solution to ship in my country. The handbag is very beautiful and flawless, well packed and it came with an invoice. It was a great first experience and for sure I will order other items !"
52,"With my new sneakers, the package is really nice and beautiful. It was an excellent purchase at an excellent price. I can't say enough good things about this place: quick shipment, well-packaged items, and a personal thank you message."
53,The best customer service there is! I found a hell of a deal on a loafer that was in the warehouse and after placing my order online I started to question if the 11 was the right size.  I called in to ask if someone could grab both the 11 and 12 from the warehouse was assured it was not a problem at all.  I came in the next day and sure enough the 11 fit but the 12 was there just in case.  Great experience as always.
54,"Really lovely and luxurious packaging with my new shoes. It would have been great if they offered some type of promo code for first time buyers from the website, but I understand not all retailers off this. Otherwise really wonderful service."
55,"AK Rikks is a trusted source for men's and women's apparel. I have ordered a number of items from them over the last few years for my wife and I and the product always shows up well packaged with a quick delivery. If it doesn't fit, you can easily return for a refund."
56,"Exceptional service even from an online experience. Great selection of must have items, and they have fast shipping. I will definitely be a repeat customer."
57,"Fast shipping, great customer support , and when I received my package it even include a hand written note thanking me for the purchase! Overall very good experience and would shop here ahain"
58,Sweet price on the shirt I wanted plus fee and fast shipping. That's about as good as it gets.Kudos!Chris Gibson
59,I cannot tell you how much I appreciated your personal customer service. I love your flannel box packaging as well. You worked as an incredible team to send a present overnight to my dear friend in England. She was thrilled. Forget 5 stars! A full sky of stars would not be enough! Thank you!!
60,"AK RIKK's is amazing! They retroactively applied a missing 20% coupon that saved me a ton of money, they shipped quickly and swiftly in an amazing box, and the return policy was perfect in giving me peace of mind. I will definitely be using AK RIKK's as a go-to."
61,"First time buying from here so I ordered a few $80 hoodies.. Got no confirmation, the money came right out of my account so I emailed them to ask what's going on so it's been 4 days and no response and no way to contact them any other way! So now I gotta call my bank and tell them it was fraud and get my money back."
62,"For this is the best Clothing Store for men, high quality product, smooth transaction and fast delivery"
63,Spent over a $100 on t-shirts and a Hoodie. Washed it once picture faded and streak lines of picture cracking.
64,I first Purchased close from y’all last year. I loved everything I got and I can say in just a years time the quality and material has gotten even better and great fit. I even needed a refund for a wrong size and it was sent over the very next day.
65,Didn’t give me an option on free shipping and ended up paying for priority shipping and still took about 3 weeks to receive the items. Will not order from here again.
66,"My boyfriend bought our daughter a tshirt and matching sweats about 2 years ago. She wore it several times so it’s been washed. Same outfit on my 2 year old yesterday. The fabric is the same, the color isn’t faded. I love it."
67,I’ve always loved hasta muerte clothing and I recently made a purchase on some hoodies and shirts and I loved it more i am definitely buying more really good quality
68,"For my first purchase ever from Hasta Muerte, I chose the $100 mystery box and I just gotta say- worth every penny I spent on it 🤩 my daughter stole one of the hoodies before I even got a chance to wear it 🤣😭 but I’m definitely going to be a customer “Hasta Muerte” 💯"
69,"Amazing brand, beautiful quality, and a price that makes the items feel quality, fire 🔥"
70,Favorite Online Streetwear Brand I’ve found! I came across Hastamuerte and have been nothing but satisfied with the product quality and style. Their constant releases and variety of items keep me coming back and wanting to buy more. There’s no other brand like this one and I’ll continue to support because of the great customer service!
71,I ordered 3 T-shirts. Products were delivered a few days late.  Quality was average
72,"I’ve purchased clothing from Hastamuerte numerous times and their product is high quality at all times. Never had any issues with shipping or anything. I love the products and I’m a supporter of their brand. Keep up the good work, it’s a appreciated."
73,I don't typically write reviews but I felt compelled to do so with this one. If I could give customer service 10 stars I absolutely would! Ordered a t shirt and it was just a bit defective from processing or whatever. I emailed support about the issue they got back to me very quickly and agreed to replace the item without hesitation. The quality of the product is great so totally looking forward to receiving my new one! What a great company with outstanding service!!!
74,These shirts are some of the best I've personally bought online or in store .just so well done perfect feel ....just quality overall definitely worth the wait and price .
75,"I ordered a ""trust noone"" face mask, when I got it, I noticed a seam coming apart, so I sent them a pic. They replaced the mask for free and allowed me to keep the other, no questions asked. Was a breathe of fresh air to be treated as human with an issue that could be solved simply. Very appreciative of the treatment and plan on buying more products."
76,Best clothing company on the market! Made of great quality always delivers even when they’re late they send updates an offer to make it right to keep you posted.When the quality isn’t the best they know they need to upgrade and they do it I’ve never been let down and everywhere I go people see the clothing and they complement it! 12 out of 10
77,Love the products. Best styling in the industry by far. Always exceptional service and quality is always on point. And if anything ever does happen (which is rare) the customer service is amazing. They work with you and make it right. Very smooth experience overall. I will definitely be a life long customer and continue to show my support. Love everyone at the company. Show your support you won’t be disappointed 💯
78,I love you guys...your clothing is SO DAMN DOPE.  I wore the 2 hoodies I bought from your site...as well as the shirts I received from you.  My wife bought me a cold bucks T shirt for my birthday at hibbetts...which I was shocked that they carried your clothing.  I wore that shirt with my UNC JORDAN 3s and some jeans...perfect fit for the day.  Keep up the great work...you know I am definitely a fan of your clothing.
79,"Hasta Muerte hands down the best qualityproducts on the market. Products fit wonderfully and perfect for any occasion. I am 14 shirts in and still get compliments in public. Great brand not only for the amazing quality, but the excellent customer service!"
80,"Lol I see they pay for people to write reviews. I ordered product on the 13th, it’s the 23rd and it hasn’t been shipped. Even though I paid $21 for priority shipping the is supposed to come to my house in 4 business days. They emailed me they are like 8 days behind filling orders so a couple of y’all are lying on here. Won’t give me my priority shipping fee back. Never order from here they suck."
81,"Otrium is a year-around gem to have; I’ve stopped shopping with my regular brands and I’m spending all my time and money shopping at Otrium building my forever, timeless, dream wardrobe. I have to dress for four seasons, so there’s always something “l need”! :-)"
82,Excellent experience ordered items and received everything in a timely manner it was well worth it
83,"I thought Otrium was too good to be true.  How could prices be so great?  I turned to Trustpilot for reassurance and went ahead and ordered (a lot).  Every item was perfectly packaged; every item was new; free delivery was fast; returns free, as well.  What's not to love?"
84,Excellent seller. Fast shipping and order processing. I am satisfied with the product. Everything corresponds to the description and photo.
85,Nice clothing deals. Exceptional service and shipping speeds. Items were packaged professionally.
86,"Very easy to buy, the order was fast. Previously, one of the items needed to be returned and it was also easy and fast."
87,"I've become a (too) regular shopper on the Otrium site and I couldn't choose a better company to buy from.  Their customer service aims to please, their sales are generous and frequent enough, and there's always FREE SHIPPING! Hope as it gets more popular that the things I've come to love about it stay the same. Highly recommend!"
88,"I randomly found this site while searching for a pair of Alala leggings and couldn't believe my eyes when I found them at 60% off! I immediately started perusing the site and ended up buying 5 things for less than $250. Everything was over 50% off and such great brands and selections. I sent it to all of my friends and they are now obsessed too. I just placed my 3rd order since discovering it a week ago. Magical but incredibly dangerous! Free returns, free shipping, i mean, it's like a sustainable version of amazon for amazing brands. LOVE IT!"
89,"First time customer for the website.  I’m usually very cautious when it comes to online shopping.  After reading the reviews and checked out the merchandise,  then decided to pull the trigger and made a purchase.  Then I got an email stated that order will be delayed.  Oh oh.  I thought it’s not good!  Did I made a right decision to purchase from this website?  Thought maybe it’s not a reliable website.  I do have to say that this is a legit website with genuine merchandise.  The shipment delivered within time!  I made a second order soon after.  Great merchant!"
90,"This site has all my favorite brands! Especially The Flexx and Faherty! Also a new favorite, Outerknown. I love that these brands are sustainable.  That’s important to me. The prices are amazing! With any online shopping returns are a Necessary evil. Thanks Otrium for including a return slip and label to make this part a breeze. And returns are free!! I’ll definitely be using and raving about Otrium for the future!"
91,"Ordered several items from them, arrived as described.  Service was expedient, received the order within 3 days.  Very happy with the purchases"
92,Otrium is one of the better sample sale sites out there. They do not have a time limit and so it’s a better shopping experience. I have made 5 purchases so far and have only made one return. Unlike sample sales their return policy is top notch (free returns).
93,"I love using this site. The options and the selections are great.. The sizing is a bit confusing because many of the articles come from different countries that use different scales that used different scales for sizing. That presents a problem for me being American and us having a fairly standard set of sizes. Other than that I'm very happy with the site. I'm happy with the delivery, it's very fast. The discounts are deep and the quality of the products is very high. I highly recommend Otrium  to anyone!"
94,Awesome prices on awesome products; super fast shipping; I highly recommend this online store!
95,"I ordered an item and then the system canceled it and returned the money automatically. I really wanted the order so I contacted Otrium help center. Anna answered and gave me a free shipping discount, but when I told her that I can no longer find my desired item she apologized and gave me an additional 15% discount.She was very nice to me and also this was not the first time I talked to her. She was always very helpful, prompt and also very kind.I would definitely recommend Otrium.com!!! Excellent service and attitude towards customers."
96,"This place is great since the product selection, fair prices and customer service. I had a small issue with the product I received - the clasp wasn’t working properly - and their customer service blew my mind. It was so so good! They most definitely have my business."
97,I’m in love with the top. The price was amazing and I did not see this item available on other websites. Shipping was fast and easy. I will definitely shop again.
98,"Amazing Belstaff merchandise at the fraction of what it would cost elsewhere, I’m in love with my new jacket. Two beautiful linen jumpsuits from Faherty were a steal as well. Items ship almost immediately and are at my front door within 3 days on average. Highly recommend this company, I have already been recommending them to all of my friends"
99,I love that My items were shipped immediately.
100,I order from Otrium often. The prices are amazing and the returns are free. My Belstaff collection is wonderful thanks to Otrium!
101,"Great service.  Shipping was quicker than stated, and communication was great.  Price was the best I had seen on these, including, in Hawaii!"
102,I initally gave a 5 Star review but this rating system is to difficult so I chaged it to worst rating
103,I loved the shoes and am pleased with the packaging and shipping as well. Thank you!
104,Great kilt hangers. Nice darkly stained hardwood. Four sturdy metal clips that are enameled won't cause any damage to my kilts. The kilts hang very flat and level with these to maintain pleats. I recommend these.
105,They advertise the wrong color for their golden brown timberland pro boots. Aka they lie to their customers. Extremely disappointed.
106,"Easy, quick, fast loved my item and loved the quick shipping"
107,"The Dansko clogs & sandals are perfect but for some reason were shipped to CA before coming to FL? Am error on shippers part, obviously, but they took 2 weeks to get to me. Longest I have ever waited for an order from lebos."
108,This was my first time ordering from Lebo's and it was a GOOD experience. My shoes shipped to me pretty quickly and were in Great Shape. The quality of the shoes is really GOOD also. Thanks for a good experience Lebo's.
109,"I just discovered Lebos in North Carolina. I placed an order for a pair of clogs and within a few days I had them delivered to my home in TN. Unfortunately they didn't fit, so I sent them back. Within a day of reaching them they sent an email that my account has been credited already. That is what I say is good customer service. Now looking forward to visiting their western ware store. My husband wears those cowboy hats so it sounds like a great store for both of us."
110,"Received two Breyer Romero, just like I ordered. But they were just wrapped in the plastic shipping bag. Both models boxes were damaged! So a little disappointed they would shipped not in box. But looks like model look ok!"
111,"I was searching on the web for Carolina on my mind Bogg bag. The color was a bit hard to find. I came across Lebos and not only did they have the color,they had large and baby. So I order both. Came in a few days and the packaging was perfect!! I have no complaints"
112,Bought some sandals and they are perfect. Fast shipping and great customer service too.
113,Wonderful first experience with Lebo's! I ordered my granddaughter's dance shoes. They arrived in a very timely manner. I was updated in email with the shipment progress. The selection is great!
114,"since I live in VA and on border of Kingsport TN, these shoes came FAST! I see that you are located in NC. These white flatfoot shoes without taps were delivered in my mailbox. Excelllent quality, just what I was looking for. These are hard to find..I thank you tarheels!"
115,I’ve been looking for the Hey Dude’s Wendy’s white crochet shoes in a size 7 for quite some time. Lebo’s had them in stock whereas nobody else did. They shipped them in record speed and with absolutely no problems. Will definitely be doing business with them again! Wish we had Lebo store near us!
116,"I recently just learned of Lebos from my daughter in law. I bought 2 pairs of Hey Dudes. I wasn’t sure of the sizing, I normally wear a 7.5, somewhere I read to go up a size, so I bought the 8. Unfortunately they were too big. Lebos made exchanging them for a size 7 so easy and they shipped extremely fast!  I love my shoes and will definitely buy from Lebos again!"
117,Ordered pair of shoes from their website and they were awesome! A friend of mine recommended them and it was no mistake to submit an order. I will definitely recommend them to more people!
118,Somehow I accidentally ordered the waterproof version of these but ended up loving them. Quick shipping and solid communication from Lebos regarding shipping. Will definitely buy from them again.
119,"I couldn’t have asked for anything better. Web site was easy to order from, delivery was very fast as promised. Extremely satisfied!"
120,"After paying $139.99 for a pair of the Dansko Pace Ladies shoes and wearing them on a few times indoors only, the glued on treads on the bottom of the sole of the shoes are coming off!  Bad design and poor quality."
121,Love my new alpaca wool scarf. Got exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to place my order and it was ready to be sent out the same day and received it in 2 days. Thank you!
122,The Peaky Blinders hat is good-looking and the XL fits very well.  Hats are true to size.  My wife loves it on me!  I love the extended bill.  The shipping time was fantastic.  The hat came in just a few days.  Overall a great experience.  I will order more hats from this provider.
123,"Although I haven't received my order yet, the process of shopping online and ordering was pleasant and straightforward. I look forward to wearing my items when they arrive."
124,"I love my cap with the Celtic Dog on it. However, I wish the design would have chosen some more contrasting color for the embroidery"
125,"the quality of this clothing is impeccable!  I have been looking for new Irish linen cap for a while now, I have a black and natural color caps from my visits to the Emerald Isle . The two i purchased from Celtic Clothing were beautiful and different shades of green. I will enjoy them next spring and summer. But the weather is changing in the Pocono Mts. in PA so i will wear my wool caps from Muckros and Hannah hats from Eire, San agus Beannacht;"
126,"I purchased the ladies wool wrap, it feels soft and durable. It will be a versatile piece as I often find coats too bulky to wear. As a suggestion, in the online catalog listing of clothing I’d like to see more views (front, back, side) of the items."
127,Using the website was easy and informative. I have not received the items yet but the turn around time from order to shipping was less than 1 day. Celtic Clothing is an outstanding shop to shop with.
128,"I have bought several items from Celtic Clothing over the years. The merchandise is high-quality, reasonably priced and always arrives promptly. I will buy from them again, and I would recommend them highly to anybody looking for clothing and accessories that are made in Ireland."
129,I found the shopping experience quite pleasant and efficient. The tracking technology was more than helpful. I will gladly purchase more products in the future.
130,I ordered a green knit sweater of Irish wool. It arrived very quickly and in great shape. It is a typical well made
131,The package was delivered in a timely manner. The shirt is a very nice quality and fit is true to size.
132,"Charles and his staff working the Dublin, Ohio Irish Festival went above and beyond to help me find just the right rugby shirt and cap that I wanted. Everyone's customer service and friendliness were top notch. I'm very satisfied with my purchases, and I will buy again. Thank you, sláinte!"
133,This company is great! My item was on back order but when it shipped it came two day priority mail which I thought was above and beyond. The sweater is incredibly beautiful and excellent quality. I am happy.
134,"Exactly as described.  Very fast shipping. Good, quality clothing. Thanks"
135,"Very Quick delivery and good quality T shirts at very good pricing. Always easy to select items on the website. EXCEPT: Would be 5 stars except for the very annoying Captcha buttons and its picture games for account login and for PayPal. I already gave you my account password and my PW for Pay Pal, so get rid of the redundant Captcha buttons. Quite Annoying. Thanks."
136,I was a little apprehensive at first given I ordered a tweed cap. I have experience with wool berets and they are not comfortable at all haha however this cap is simply stunning. Amazing fit. True to size great fabric feel and quality. 10/10
137,"I would have given 5 stars, but they are not what I expected. I have purchased grandfather shirts elsewhere. I thought these would be a little lighter weight, for summer. They are wearable in summer, but a little on the warmer/heavier side. Still, good shirts for a good price."
138,Please list size dimensions for vests in inches measuring length/chest/and waist.  The vest dimensions do not match shirt dimensions. I selected a 2XL vest based on 2XL shirt sizes I purchased through your store. The vest was not as large as the shirt I bought. I paid shipping out of my pocket expense to return the vest. The additional information will be very helpful. Quality product otherwise.
139,I had a minor issue with my order and they communicated well during the process and made it right. I recommend them and would purchase from them again without reservations.
140,Ordered linen cap.  Arrived timely and in good shape.  Appears to be of very good quality.  It is lightweight which is ideal for hot weather.
141,I use this platform evrytime I have in mind something I need and it never fails to find something that suits my needs for me this is the best website for people.
142,"Very good store with ideal stuff. But sometimes my order is delay. Nevertheless, I like to use this service"
143,"I am highly recommend this store, very good quality and excellent attitude to the customers"
144,Excellent Product of excellent Quality provide with an  excellent Service ... meaning that my Experience ( not the First-One ) ... is still excellent.Good Job Guys .. you made me proud again to wear a USA Kilt
145,"Excellent customer service. I accidentally ordered two shirts twice. They took the time to call me to see if I really wanted the extra order. You can’t beat that. Looking forward to seeing my husband’s kilt, it should be coming soon. Great videos too, we have learned a lot."
146,"These shirts of which I now have 3! Fit the bill well for Mass , a night out with a casual yet gentleman apparel !  Work well with both Kilt & jeans ,"
147,"USA Kilts is an outstanding organization, from top to bottom, with excellent customer service, a high-quality product, and superb educational tools. I am a cancer patient and am unable to wear pants due to radiation burns. USA Kilts accelerated their production process in order to outfit me with a gorgeous kilt and accessories when I needed them the most. Having a background in marketing and sales, I cannot speak highly enough of their trained staff and knowledge of their product. After researching possible kilt sources, I was blessed to have discovered USA Kilts and not fall for the knock-off kilts from Pakistan. I am now a new and faithful customer, having made additional purchases to expand my regalia. Kudos and thank you to USA Kilts!"
148,"I have been asking numerous questions about kilts, proper attire, etc. My questions are answered promptly and courteously. Never a ""canned"" response. My most recent question was about the placement of the sporran chain. Gillian, especially, has been wonderful about giving me clear responses and direction. That is representative of what USAKilts is all about."
149,"I bought a casual kilt called The American Heritage kilt. It is more than I expected! The quality of material used to the craftsmanship and how the kilt was made is more then I could hope for. Yes it took a while to receive the kilt, but it was much sooner then I was quoted. When I put the kilt on I was doubtful that I took my measurements correctly, but it fit perfectly!! It's nice to know that there is a company out there that still puts quality first. This company has my business for life."
150,USA Kilts never disappoints!  Love my minis for playing pipes on stage with Live Wire! And my trad and semi trad kilts for everything else.  Thanks for keeping me looking good doing what I do! Loyal repeat customer!
151,Great kilt hangers. Nice darkly stained hardwood. Four sturdy metal clips that are enameled won't cause any damage to my kilts. The kilts hang very flat and level with these to maintain pleats. I recommend these.
152,"Excellent quality of products and they are exactly as described on website.  The order was shipped  safely in a timely manner and emails kept us updated along the way.  This is our ""go to"" company from now on."
153,I was very pleased with the pleasant personality and knowledge of the young lady I spoke to regarding the gift I bought from my daughter's 25th anniversary she was thrilled and her husband thank you for such a speedy service
154,"My second casual kilt from USA Kilts. The Celtic Nations tartan was designed by a genius, the colors seem to go with any hose or shirt. Fit is perfect and the lighter weight material just feels right. I paid for RUSH service and got it in 11 days. Note I have been wearing kilts for over 30 years, I love this one!"
155,"@ last minute, I ordered a gift card for my brother for his birthday. The site stated immediate delivery. After 2 hours my brother had not received it. I sent an email and within minutes I had received a personal email with an apology. My brother received a personal email with a link and attachment for his card. PERFECT! I since have received another email with the reassurance that it wouldn't happen again and the issue would be resolved. No complaints. Highest respect for this company."
156,"The customer service was second to none. When my order got delayed in shipping they overnighted a whole other rental package just to make sure my wedding day would be everything I imagined it would be, and it was. I cannot speak more highly of this company, their professinalism, and the speed at which they assisted me, and specifically Heather for her kindness and excelllent customer service through all of the issues I experienced."
157,"Rock solid customer service. Ordered a jacket/vest combo: jacket fit perfectly, vest was a bit snug. Two emails and 4 business days later, I had the new vest in hand and I'm ready for my wedding anniversary with a week to spare. The fine folks at USA Kilts have their act together."
158,"Amazing quality, answers calls and emails promptly and they have amazing customer service skills. Very willing to help with anything and everything and answer questions. My wedding is coming up and my fiancé bought his Prince Charlie set from them- jacket was small and they did the exchange in days and expedited the shipping! Totally worth the price tag because you're paying for quality materials and service!"
159,"As a gift for my 60th birthday, my wife gifted me a great kilt package from usa kilts, and I have absolutely nothing but the very best things to say about them and their products! Everything that arrived was of top-shelf quality, their service was timely, products reasonably priced, and the people I interacted with during the process were all wonderful! They haven't seen the last of me!"
160,"I am just becoming a serial kilter. I have a heavier, ""nicer"" kilt that I got myself for my wedding (My dress cost more than my wife's), but I am looking for something to be an everyday knock-about casual kilt. The people at USA Kilts have been very helpful and patient helping me get up to speed about the various options available to me. This order was just for some swatches, but the customer service has been out of this world!"
161,"After searching online for a pair of Royal Robbins shorts, I finally found the color and size I needed at New Horizons Trading. Customer service was excellent. They confirmed the item was in stock and double checked on the shipping address. Shipping was quick and efficient. I am very happy with the purchase I made and would highly recommend this company."
162,Got my shoes quickly and they were good quality
163,"Service was outstanding! I ordered online, but had a minor problem with my address. I phoned the store and they were great! Outstanding people. Thank you all!"
164,I received my order very quickly from New Horizons Trading. Package arrived within a few days and was packed very nicely with a personal touch. There was a hand-written card inside thanking me for my order. Great customer service for an online purchase. I will definitely order from this company again!!
165,New Horizons was great.  They had exactly what I wanted for a great price and got it out to me quickly. Literally could not ask for better service.
166,The sun hat and shorts are high quality and should last a long time. The items were thoughtfully packaged and included a small gift for my daughter with a hand written thank you note for shopping small. The little touches combined with great products makes New Horizons a win win!
167,"Pleasant surprise with New Horizons Trading, found what I wanted at the best price and had my order within a couple days.  With that order came a for real handwritten thank you note with a 10% discount code.  So I went ahead and got my wife some boots that she needed and they arrived just as promptly.  You never know what an experience will be like ordering from a new place, but this is a gem.  I’ll be a return customer for sure!Ira G."
168,I searched Keen on FB for wet shoes for my daughter size 6.5 and I picked your store. I was treated well on the chat with the lady and I received shipment that was well wrapped and a personal thank you note from Mary for shopping with New Horizons. I would recommend shopping here. I’m not sure which store it came from as I’m not at home with the box it came in. Thank you
169,"New Horizons Trading in Downtown Pittsboro is my ""go to,"" ""gotta see what's new"" clothing store.  I always find interesting, comfortable and fun clothes, shoes and gifts there. The staff are friendly and always willing to help but will also let you browse to your hearts content without bothering you.  I love to visit anytime I'm in the neighborhood."
170,"I love the staff and both the New Horizons stores equally! And now, online ordering with parking lot pick up….. doesn’t get much better. We are so grateful and fortunate to have these folks in our community. Awesome selections, great sales, and superior customer service. Woo-hoo! T Ladd Pittsboro, NC"
171,"Way more than you might expect to find. This is a fabulous gift shop and women’s clothing store in downtown Pittsboro. I always find something I like here: funny oven mitts, dish towels, and socks, candles, wind chimes, jewelry, soaps, skin care, baby items, high end shoes and bags, and beautiful unique clothing. The staff is truly helpful and they don’t hover. Awesome sales too - like 40-50% off shoes. I challenge you to choose a gift and card for a friend’s birthday and NOT buy something for yourself too. LOL!"
172,"I have always had such a great experience at both New Horizons Downtown and New Horizons West. They have very unique gifts, shoes, clothes, camping gear and accessories at both stores. The employees are very friendly and helpful to everyone. I highly recommend that you check out these stores."
173,"Everytime I say to someone, ""you must go to New Horizons,"" they are thrilled to have visited the stores. It was one of three local businesses that I chose to support by buying a gift certificate at the beginning at the pandemic.  Wonderful staff, great merchandise, all around wonderful!"
174,"I love these shoes; however, I wear them out quickly and this style has been discontinued. I was pleased to have found a pair online at New Horizons for a low price. They arrived quickly and should give me another 6 months of happy feet on my daily walks! Thanks."
175,"Unlike other platforms, it is quite comfy, and the designs are distinctive. I have no concerns and am satisfied with the services provided.It's simple to place an order, and the merchandise arrives quickly."
176,This is a great shop. Everyone is always very helpful but not overbearing. I am always impressed by the the shoe selection. It seems they have a better selection than some shoe stores. The clothes sre great also with a great selection of not run of the mill merchandise..
177,Awesome service!!!Love what I ordered and although I had an issue with shipping. Liz was awesome at comunicating with me in tracking down my package and i finally received within a couple days of the mix up. I will definitely be doing business with New Horizon again!!!
178,"I love New Horizons, both stores!  I do a lot of Xmas gift shopping at the Downtown location.  And sometimes I splurge on something for myself from New Horizons West.  Staff at both stores are always helpful.  And the things they stock are so cool and interesting!"
179,"These guys are the absolute best. When we were planning a major trip to the Himalayas, they helped us stock up on lots of the things we needed, and ordered stuff they didn't have. I love them. Also they carry great shoes at the downtown spot."
180,"Love New Horizons!! I go there for my shoes, clothing, cards, camping and small gifts.  I’m native to Pittsboro but drive back from Durham to my shopping there.  They have all the best shoes for support which I need and looks.   The service and advice from their staff are great!! I call the New Horizons West my local REI for camping and outdoors wear.  The New Horizons downtown is my favorite for that special novelty gift and cards galore.  If you haven’t stopped by one of these stores, it is a must on Pittsboro and worth your drive!  Oh and yes they have awesome gift wrapped bags for those special presents. My favorite is the butterfly 🦋 paper."
181,"I can’t tell you how many compliments I have received from wearing all the jewelry I have invested in from this company. It truly is so magnetic to look at and people ask me all the time where I got my chains from. 10/10 recommend. I will be back for the rest. Also shoutout to Nelle, thank you for your superb customer service you made everything super easy. 👍"
182,"Every product I’ve ordered from JAXXON has been perfect! The 14K gold material looks stunning and has lasted almost two year so far! I’ve had a great experience with their customer service, and I recently talked to Ray, who helped me find what I needed!! I absolutely love this company and I hope one day they have a better variety of women’s jewelry."
183,"Their response time to getting back to you was far more impressive than I’ve seen from any other company. No lie. I received a 15% discount to use, however the expiration date to use the discount had passed. I figured I would reach out and see if they would honor the 15% for me. Not thinking I would get a reply anytime soon, I ended up getting a response in less than 10 min, with the discount being honored. Because of that quick response, and the discount (lol), I went and bought 2 silver chains. Very impressed! Thank you!"
184,"I had made a mistake while ordering my husbands gift for our wedding anniversary. I miss spelled my email and i noticed that i never received a receipt or a confirmation number. I emailed the company and expressed my concern and gave them my name, number, and my real email with no mistakes. Erly K was fantastic and sent me an email letting me know they are looking into it. Not long after i received another email with my receipt number and tracking for the necklace along with the estimated arrival date. Erly offered even more assistance if needed. I am truly impressed and appreciative of the communication."
185,"My order was placed on September the 22, 2022. For a double rope chain stack for $230.00. The order seemed to be lost. I wasnt sure what happened to it, there seemed to be a mishap with either the shipping department or with FedEx. So i called customer support and spoke with Erly and she was very helpful. Sending me an email letting me know another shipment would be sent out for me. Thank you"
186,The return process could have been much better. The whole thing total took about 3 months in order for me to get my jewelry returned. On top of everything I had to pay extra $40 to get the jewelry I ordered back because the Black Chain Set that comes with both the bracelet and chain was not available. So I was forced to pay extra money to buy something that I ALREADY OWNED.
187,"I purchased the franco chain and cuban chain silver bundle, and while it arrived promptly and in good packaged, the cuban link chain arrived with some of its links twisted. they are very hard to untwist, and will revert itself to its twisted state when wearing. this happens multiple times a day and is quite annoying. if this was not an issue I would write 5 stars, however I simply can't when such an expensive item is in this condition upon arrival"
188,"The chain at first glance and my first few times wearing it was good, the chain felt nice. After wearing it for maybe a week or so I noticed the Cuban Links would constantly get ""locked up"" or there would be like a kink in the links as if the links were too loosely put together/there was just maybe too much space for the links to to move too freely. I've had quite a few Cuban links and if I have had experienced what's been happening with my Jaxxon chain, it was a middle of the mall fake type $50 tag.I was really excited to get this Jaxxon Cuban but its almost become too annoying to wear having to fix the chain kinking up all the time."
189,Great instant customer service with  online chat. Marie is indeed a rock star. So refreshing to get answers and solutions immediately.I’m waiting to see the chain I bought for my son in law’s birthday and his reaction to a bracelet. The products are awesome and prices accesible. Love Jaxxon’s for my three sons in law!
190,"I recently placed an order on Jaxxon. Unfortunately, the address information was submitted incorrectly. Fortunately, after emailing them, I received a prompt reply back confirming the correct address information from Carla at Jaxxon. This is quality customer service."
191,"I had a good experience with ordering and receiving my necklace.It was thinner and more narrow width than I expected but looks good.It would be nice if you would offer a size drawing of each necklace so I can determine what mm I would like.Thank you, Robert Eckler"
192,"Ordered a 2mm 22 inch solid gold Rope Chain, fast forward two days UPS 2 day airmail gets here. I open the package, and the chain is missing from the package. I also found a bottlecap from what I suspect is a warehouse worker. My problem has yet to be solved, so I'm out $721 and support has stopped responding to me. THIS IS NOT A GOOD JEWELRY COMPANY, PLEASE ORDER ELSEWHERE"
193,I bought a gold link bracelet but it was too small for my wrist. Within 1/2 hour of my request for a store credit RAY took care of it and even sent a prepaid return label. He was understanding and immediately arranged  for the return. Good On Ya!
194,Smoothest transaction you could ask for. Product delivered quickly and just as I had expected. Didn’t have any dealing with customer service on this transaction but my dealings in the past have been pleasant and very professional and efficient.
195,"Loved my products and when I had a problem with one, Ray was incredibly responsive in helping me solve the problem!  Great jewelry, great quality and even better customer service! This combination is what makes people lifetime customers!"
196,"Mel definitely has superb customer service skills. Although my visit today was merely about enquiring about the availability of an item, I feel as if I left with some gold anyway 🤣. Thanks Mel."
197,Order the Cuban chain on September 23rd said it was delivered on the 30th it was not the case had to wait another 3 days and turns out the product is amazing can’t wait to give it to my son for his birthday. Tiara was great too btw!
198,Really amazing customer service. Joanne did everything to make sure I was 120% happy with everything. It makes me proud to wear an item where the company stands behind its product. I will definitely recommend Jaxxon to others.
199,"Want to start out by saying that from someone who has a decent amount of experience and knowledge regarding websites and the proper layouts etc you guys have created a great experience from that alone. Everything is easily found, any questions are always answered on an amazing time basis and your jewelry looks fantastic. I have bought two chains for my lady that she wanted for Christmas and I thoroughly looked them over and was not disappointed in the slightest. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future for her and myself as well. Keep up the amazing work!"
200,Honestly where do I even start! Super special shout out to Marie who assisted me at 4am honestly I thought I was going to have to submit an email question but nope she was quick to reply to the chat box super cool btw! Not only that but her product knowledge was outstanding she walked me through sizing for a proper chain stack and as a fluffy sized male these things matter because at least for my body type the 26inch sits like a 22inch she was super cool and understanding of my needs and what I had in mind. Super pleased she helped me out with everything. Thank you Marie!!!
201,"As true to their word, My first shirt was off just a little in measurements for my body, The tailor store made recommendations and are in the process of making me a new shirt. Can beat it, if the new shirt fits as I expect I will replace my entire wardrobe oof dress shirts."
202,"Wow, what amazing customer service.The quality of the shirt was amazing I ordered but was a tad tight, I followed their instructions and they immediately re credited me and amended my profile to enable me to reorder the right size.The shirt originally delivered was then gifted to me to donate to charity.Looking for to my amended shirt.Can’t rate highly enough"
203,"Ordered my first shirt, fit was slightly off in a couple of spots.  The Tailor Store and Kivindri specifically responded immediately and had me send photos so they could make adjustments and send me a new shirt.  Great service, great quality clothing and super convenient.   Looking forward to ordering more."
204,"The customer service is FABULOUS! I ordered a shirt, it didn't quite fit in the shoulders and biceps...they responded immediately! They made the adjustments and shipped a new shirt to me, which made me REALLY feel like the custom shirt experience was/is worth it. BRAVO, Tailor Store! You are getting it right."
205,"Phenomenal customer service! Nothing but crystal clear communication from this company. The shirt I ordered was very high quality, but I was a bit unhappy with my fabric choice and I must've taken some wrong measurements. These were my mistakes, but they went above and beyond to make it right. I would highly recommend this company to anyone."
206,"I had a brilliant experience with TailorStore. They only sent out one shirt from my order as a test. The fit was nearly perfect but needed some slight tweaks. They re-made the shirt for free changing some of the dimensions based on photos of me wearing the first shirt. Joacim, my contact was very helpful. This shirt fitted perfectly! The quality of the shirts is outstanding. I've just received the rest of my order and they are beautiful. The split yoke on the back of the checked shirt has been book-matched. I love details like that. I will recommend this service to my friends without hesitation, thank you!"
207,"Having dealt with previous supplier of made to measure shirts and been disappointed, I wasn't sure how this order would go. However it could not have been better. Excellent service together with a great product. Would anyone looking for a new shirt or shirts to try them. You won't be disappointed!"
208,"Love the quality of what I have gotten to this point and the service had been great. Would recommend for anyone wanting a great shirt, but especially for anyone with out of the norm measurements. They've gone out of their way to make it right."
209,"Fantastic customer service, great products, the t shirt I ordered looks great and I can’t wait to order more."
210,"I got measured on two different occasion and was told you are never finding a shirt that fits you nicely in a store (they were right). I was tired of just settling for shirts that didn't look good on me. I googled customer dress shirts and started using the site. It was so easy to take the measurements they needed, and when I tried on the first shirt I was amazed at how good a shirt can feel when it is made literally FOR YOU. I will be ordering more shirts from them."
211,"Used the iPhone photo measurements, shirt came and was perfect aside from slightly too much material around the arms and too long. I contacted Joacim at customer service and had a new shirt ordered (free of charge) within an hour. It has since arrived and it fits pefectly and is excellent quality. Couldn't recommend Tailor Store enough."
212,"Tailor store proactively let me know, because it's my first order of two shirts, they will make one first to ensure it fits, as it turns out it was a little large. I was asked for picutres, they made the adjustment and send me the shirt and it did fit perfectly the second time. Only then they made the second shirt after I confirmed. Needless to say they have gained my trust and confidence to order again in future"
213,"Wow!! I am extremely impressed with the service received from Tailor Store.... My dress shirt was made exactly as ordered, fits beautifully and looks so good! Delivery was fast and efficient, without any delays at all. Top quality all round, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
214,"First order was too big, but they replaced it for free. The second order fit perfectly."
215,Excellent customer service. They’ll make sure your shirt is perfect. Fast delivery too.
216,"I have an athletic build and local men's clothing stores and their tailors usually have a hard time fitting me with off-the-rack clothing. After being disappointed with my last attempt at finding clothes for work, I started looking into online made-to-measure services.  Tailor Store was the only service/website with good reviews that also had a measurement system that made sense. The 1st few times the fit of the clothes was close but not quite right but customer service came through and made everything right. Communication with customer service was excellent and once the adjustments to the measurements were made, the fit of the clothes was perfect. Over the past few months, I have ordered 15 dress shirts, 2 jackets, 3 suits and a few pairs of pants.  All arrived quick and were packed well. The craftsmanship of the clothing and fabric quality are awesome."
217,"Site was easy to use and a good selection of fabric to choose from, I ordered one just to make sure I would like it, ten minutes after I opened it I ordered four more. These shirts are absolutely amazing."
218,"They're amazing,  but , but , It'll be nice to give clients space to adjust measurements , or to add comments with the order , probably more fabric variations would help , Good luck"
219,Everything was great! I was able to get a test shirt to ensure everything fit just right. It did and the other shirts followed in a timely fashion.
220,"Tailor Store has incredible customer service and their goods deliver. I first ordered only one shirt to ensure I liked the fit. It was immediately the best fitting shirt I own except that it was extraordinarily long. I contacted tailor store to see if they could adjust my profile to fix this issue for future orders and they not only corrected the issue for future orders, but sent me a brand new shirt with the corrected measurements free of charge. I’ve since ordered several more. Highly recommend!"
221,"This was my first time ordering.  The items I ordered were mostly as expected, however there was a mixup in color/size/product of one shipment.  I contacted customer service and Charlie immediately helped process my return.  Despite a little hiccup, I would definitely order again. Charlie made the experience seamless and I very much appreciated the assistance and follow up."
222,I have to say Charlie cox over at wordans was an absolute pleasure! Although there was an issue with my order he responded to my email immediately with a phone call and an email. He made sure the situation was Resolved and that I was happy with the outcome. Because of Charlie wordans now has a life long customer!!
223,"After receiving an item that was the wrong size, Anna was extremely prompt in getting back to me about the mix up. Her customer service was top notch and it makes me feel confident that I am ordering from a fantastic company."
224,"I found this site when searching for a specific apparel item, since then they have been my go to for all my apparel needs. I receive great help from Adiel! I highly recommend this company. Shipping is quick too!"
225,"Upon receiving my order, I had a damaged item and Anna was quick to assess the issue and send a replacement right away. Thank you Anna for all the help and your great customer service. I will be ordering from you guys again and wish you a great day !"
226,"I have made multiple purchases on Wordans.com and they are always fast and easy, also the customer support team is very helpful, I had some trouble tracking my order and Adiel from the support team provided me with excellent aid."
227,"Adiel was very helpful when I asked about stock and sizes.  He was very friendly and prompt, and even updated the website to reflect current available stock!  I will be purchasing soon!"
228,Recently used Wordans for the first time to order some youth hoodies. One of the hoodies had some stitching issues. I sent an email in and customer service contacted me within the hour. Adiel was excellent and quickly assured me they would get a replacement item sent right out. Great customer service and quick response. I will for sure order again.
229,"I am very impressed with the ease and response of working with Wordans on our order that was just placed. When calling with questions regarding our new account (tax expempt), Adiel not only talked me through the easiest process to establish our status, but made sure that our account was ready immediately for me to place the order. Adiel also spoke with genuine interest in me as a client and his tone was friendly and professional, efficient and knowledgeable. It was probably the best customer service call I've had in a long while."
230,"There was a more than 1 month delay on my order, but with that said, they were communicative, helpful and professional and gave me the option to cancel. Would recommend :)"
231,"I needed hoodies quickly so I could add HTV vinyl for them! I am unsure how I found Wordans, but I have been thrilled with the speed. I also reached out to Adiel for support regarding questions for my order. They responded quickly and ensured me that my order would be here in time. I will absolutely use Wordans again for materials."
232,"I just want to say big thank you to Anna, who helped me with my lost package! I really appreciate such a great customer support!"
233,My experience was great with this company. I had Charlie C. help me through my issues with my account. By the time we were finished he had everything figured out and had processed my refund on the spot. Charlie was extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with. Thank you Charlie for all of your help.
234,Had an issue regarding missing/shorted items but Charlie sorted it out and was a great help. Communication is everything to me and Charlie was on top of it and friendly friendly and helpful.Thanks again Charlie for all your help!
235,Customer service has been fantastic. Simona N received my call when I had an issue with the shipment I received. She immediately took measures to resolve the issue and I received an email from her within 15 minutes of our phone confirmation. Her resolution was fast and much appreciated. I will definitely be ordering more in the future.
236,When I received my shipment I was missing 5 shirts. I called and talked to Charlie Cox and he was so much help. He took care of the problem while we were on the phone. This is the second time I have had to call Wordans regarding an order and both times they have been great to work with. Will continue using them for all my shirt orders.
237,"Adiel E was extremely helpful when I contacted the company concerning my order.  Not only was he able to execute on my needs, he couldn't have been a nicer person.  Thank you!"
238,"I cannot recommend Wordans enough. I had a small issue with an order and Anna was wonderful. She was pleasant, kind, listened, and most importantly resolved my issue is a time efficient manner."
239,"Ordered hats from this company, I hadn’t received an order number or confirmation, so I reached out to customer service and asked what was going on and Charlie assured me that they did send one out and it had gone to my old email address that was linked to my Amazon account and I was able to find the email and confirm that I had received it previously, and he re sent me the email just to make sure i did receive it. Charlie was super helpful and made it a pleasant experience, made sure everything was taken care of and was extremely helpful."
240,I had an issue with my account and Anna was absolutely amazing and corrected the problem right away.  She was very professional and handled the conversation like a pro. She has got to be a huge asset to your company! Thank you Anna for a job well done. I wish all the phone calls I have to make during the day were as pleasant as Anna's call.  It was a pleasure doing business with you!For some reason I can not leave a review for anyone else so I will leave it on this one.Charlie also helped me and I have to say He was more than professional and extremely helpful. He set up my account so fast which in turn helped me to get back to my customer just as fast! Thank you Charlie! You are also an asset to this company!Both Charlie and Anna deserve raises! They are very good at their job and definitely should be recognized!
241,"I Love Tag clothing for going on Safari! Cotton is King when you are trying to be stealthy during a stalk. I wish you had better inventory in the US, I would order more close 😉Only quality feedback... in a couple of the shirts I got last year at DSC, the threads for the buttons are coming loose prematurely. Not a big deal. Still love you guys! Keep Zimbabwe working!"
242,"Speedy service, great updates and high quality product!  Already placed my second order, after receiving the first. Excellent experience!"
243,"I loved everything included in the services, service offers Tag Safari.. Goods that meet the requirements in terms of quality for the necessary purposes, especially travel. My advice, love to travel then you will be happy here, and your vacation will be successful and comfortable."
244,Great product Closest to a “real” issued tropical jacket I have seen that isn’t surplus Well made and fits - this is a warm weather jacket so don’t try and wear a heavy sweater underneath The rolled sleeve button tabs are just rightGlad to buy a great product and help other companies
245,My shirt is in the best qualityLove my Shirt which I will be using it as a uniform for the ROVERING 4 LIFE ASSOCIATION once I get approved
246,"The pants are great, very comfortable and light weight.  The only inseam offering was 32 "". I bought them thinking they would be long  they are and I'm having them shortened.  that is my issue to solve.  I do think the waist band could be a little more sturdy and the belt loops about 1/4"" wider.  That said these are great pants for warm weather outdoors activities.  In my case dog training and fly fishing."
247,"Excellent products, fit is to correct size, very lightweight and so good I re-ordered almost immediately! I like the fact they use 100 percent cotton. Roy"

251,"The three khaki safari shirts and the two pairs of khaki safari pants I purchased from TAG Safari arrived at my home very quickly, fit nicely, and were of excellent quality. Good value for the dollars spent. I anticipate wearing them on a South Africa photography safari in a few weeks."
252,Absolutely awesome service - when they didn't have a pair of pants I wanted someone called me within minutes of placing my order to ask if I wanted a credit or if they could help me find another pair of pants similar to what I attempted to order.  Thank you so much.....
253,This is my second piece of clothing from Tag Safari and it is as impeccably well made as the first. I will continue to be a Tag Safari customer for many years to come.
254,"I really appreciated your speedy service. It was nice that you were able to make the belt I wanted, due to you not have one on hand in my size, and was surprised at the fact my order was delivered in a few days, and the crock belt looks great.Keep up the great work.Carl"

259,"Dear TAG SafariI was expecting to have a “Door to Door» service with UPS and I paid for it. The item arrived to Greece and delivered to the public postal services and NOT TO A COURIER!Consequently,because of,I have to pay 45 USD more in taxes,I have to go to search for it to an office somewhere in Athens but I have an arthritis problem and I cannot move easily and moreover I do not want to go to closed public entities due to Covid pandemic!This creates me a lot of anxiety to find somebody to provide him a legal approval to take the parcel on my behalf. This should not happen. You should make your transactions convenient for your clients. I am not going to place an order again !"
260,My shooting/hunting shirt came thru very fast. I allready have 3 tag safari shirts beside this one. The quality stitching is very good and the fit is good.Great clothes for the hunt. I will be ordering more items from Tag.
261,Very few things I ordered I actually got. I got less than half my order and the rest refunded. Not a very good inventory system. Very disappointed.Chris
262,The company was very quick at getting my order out. The jacket is a Christmas gift so I can't give a review on the jacket yet. I was very happy with how the company took care of my order.
263,"First time buyer from Logan's and it is GREAT!  Very cool, different selections across many categories.  I'll definitely be back.  Good pricing, great communication, fast delivery!"

I am really happy because I have lost over 100 lbs and find more selections available.  As a plus size it's hard to find fashionable clothing that don't make you look like wearing a tent.  Again, I always found quality and look good!"
283,I have always worn suits. My boys are suit wearing young men. With the cost of everything rising I have been looking for good quality suits at a reasonable price. I ordered 3 for myself first. All fit great and look even better. I just ordered my boys at least 2 suits each. The sizing was off on one of my sons as he is a slim Jim. Exchange was no problem. Thanks so much for your care of we the customer. I will be back and I have told others about Suit Outlet.com

293,"So far so great! Mr Jim has been most helpful when ordering & making an even exchange for my husband's suits. I ordered 3 thus far. The suits are very stylish, yet very reasonably priced. My husband wears his suits a lot. I just ordered him one for his up & coming birthday. Hoping he loves the color as much as the style.😊but do much thanks to Mr. Jim, gir his welcoming & helping spirit made my return for purchase more highly likely. Thank you Mr. Jim"
294,"The initial transaction was wonderful. However, I had to return because I ordered the wrong size. Subsequent transactions were not as good. Turn around and shipping the second time was slow. In addition, I placed an order for a second suit. Response and shipping time for the second suit was also slow. Suits, however, are great!"
295,I would have given five stars but several suits I wanted were not in stock and I was unable to submit my email to be contacted when the suits would be back in stock. This will be my go-to for suits in the future and I highly recommend you give them a try. I'm confident you will not be disappointed.
296,"Everything was very easy going in placing my order but there's is one of concern. When I wanted make a correction on my order I was unable to through your(Chat or call your1888-909-0748).

297,"Ordered two walking suit, package arrived today with invoice for the two sets but only one set uin package.  Called number on the email I had received when order was placed.  Call went to voice mail, I have made several orders from this site without problem but now that this has happened I am upset and is hoping this is an error which will be corrected."
298,"The fit, finish and Affordability of this suit is amazing, I couldn’t believe it was real. I’m  ecstatic about the results of my  purchase. Not only will I recommend Suits Outlets Club to my friends and family, I’ve gone back to order more of their  apparel, thanks guys, it’s what I’ve been looking for, great clothes at a fair price."
299,"A beautiful suit, however it doesn't fit despite is having the same dimensions as clothes I wear everyday. This company's measurements are a bit skewed, so you need to order a suit larger than your measurements."
300,"Cannot objectively make a decision as I was trying to order from Bachrach and am not sure if this is the right place or not.  I will be happy to make a review once items are received.  Loved the accessibility of the site, very nice.  Thanks for the opportunity to use."
301,"UPDATE: Shuuk contacted me directly after my feedback, they were very helpful and responsive.  I appreciated their help.  Also, their returns and refund process was very fast and easy. PREVIOUS: I am a first time customer. After I placed my order, I got a post-purchase offer for an extra 12% off the shoulder bag from my order. I thought it was a discount in addition to the item already in my order, but it added a SECOND bag to the order as a separate purchase. It’s a bad and confusing user experience for the website to offer a post-purchase item at a discount for the exact same item that was already part of my order.  I did not want to have my credit card charged for both items, when I thought I was just ordering one."
302,"All my expectations were met. Fast delivery, quality products, and great customer service. Will definitely order from Shuuk again."
303,"This was my first order and did have something mis-ship.  Although they were slow to respond from my initial email request for help, four days later they fixed it quickly and all I had to do was drop it off at a FedEx store for an instant credit.  My replacement was at my house within three days and gorgeous.  All the items were so cute.  I already have another cart going."
304,I ordered two casual blouses.  Both  were nice and fit perfectly.  I received my order  in a timely  fashion.
305,"I'm from Uruguay and live in the United States; I learned about Shuuk through emails from the Uruguay Consulate.I decided to give Shuuk a shot, and I'm really impressed with the high quality of their clothing, products, services, and shipping.Two products were sold out, and my credit card was immediately refunded.FedEx delivered my order two days later.You've got a lifetime customer here.Thank you so much!!!"
306,I have a great time with customer service I will keep you as a great value.
307,The crossbody I ordered on here is cute! Such a perfect size and style for any type of event :)
308,"I bought 2 dresses. 1 I love and it is just what I was looking for. The other is such a strange material, like a cross between a swimsuit material and polyester. The print is less appealing on that fabric and all of the stitching is visible."
309,"I have never ordered from this company before, but there was a shirt I was very interested in, so I purchased it. The item was received promptly and I was very pleased that it was exactly what I saw in the picture and read in the description I am very pleased with my purchase and will consider ordering again from Shuuk."
310,I have yet to order from this and the website came up in an add. And I didn’t think it was legit until I saw these reviews saying it’s amazing quality. I am so excited to place the order soon. As well the prices are amazing. I think getting my package will feel like Christmas. I’m so excited
311,"A great shopping experience, as usual.  Your sales are amazing.  Thanks."
312,Quick shipping from Uruguay! Way better than some companies shipping within the U.S. I'm very happy with the clothes I received especially the sale prices. Really nice quality and the fit is perfect!
313,Delivery took 2 weeks and when the dress arrived it is way too small.I’m a 12 but ordered a 14 to wear loose yet I can’t even get it on.Also much lighter in colour.Can’t bothered to send back and keep track of refund so will put in the charity shop.
314,I absolutely love this company. Everything is excellent quality and the fit is spot on. Shipping to UK is unbelievably quick. I would totally recommend this company. Would give 10 stars
315,The quality of the clothes is really great for the price. Love the colors. The delivery is fast and exchanges and returns are smooth and hassle free. Would definitely recommend Shuuk to my friends.
316,Love the Lolita line of clothing  and can’t wait to try the other lines .  Amazing shipping too!
317,"I am not happy at all with the service I received from this company. I sent them several emails asking them to  provide me with the Royal Mail return label, in order to return the 3 shirts because they are very large. Unfortunately, they are ignoring my emails. Here is my order Number SK5399. Could you please send me the Royal Mail label so that I can return the shirts ?"
318,"The clothing items are great quality and are exactly as described on the webpage. Shipping was super fast and came earlier than expected. Return Policy is amazing. Free returns, no questions asked!"

322,"I am very happy with this company.  This is my second purchase, these people are very responsive and their products are quality.  Their leather is imazing.  I had to switch an item and it was done right away and with ease. Overall I am very happy with their service"
323,"Bought this jacket and what an incredible piece!  Great quality.  The leather is soft and luxurious and has no odor.  The styling is really unusual and super flattering.  To find your size, use the size chart.  I love this jacket....will definitely buy another style or color!"
324,I love this jacket. I've been looking for a signature leather jacket that doesn't break the bank. And Fan Jackets delivered. This American product is well made and designed. I'm shaped like a rectangle and this peplum asymmetrical jacket gives me an allusion of an hour glass figure. I can't wait until it's cold enough to wear it. THANK YOU!!!
325,"Excellent quality jackets. Clearly real leather as they have that nice smell to them and are very soft. The sizing estimate was perfect too, which was a relief. I'm almost sad it's summer as I want to wear it right now everywhere, but at least I'm set up for autumn now. Great company, shop with confidence!"
326,"Our experience with a return went effortlessly smooth. Fans Jackets made sure that we were satisfied customers, no additional fees, and a customer service representative that exclusively worked with us throughout the entire transaction. Fans Jackets will always be our go to store for quality products, and customer service !  Thank You All !!"
327,Bought for my Twd Negan outfit but has become my go to jacket. Exactly like the jacket Negan wears from The Walking Dead and is comfy to wear aswell as feeling and looking as high quality as promised would definitely recommend.
328,The coat was very good quality. The only problem was that the sleeves were not wide enough for my fat arms. The return process was quick and easy as long as you follow all the rules.
329,This jacket is not only beautiful it's comfortable and practical. The zip out hood is soft and perfect for rain or snowfall. This jacket hugs your curves while also providing adequate room in the breast area. I would highly recommend for anyone who wants utility and beauty together in a gorgeous soft leather jacket!
330,Peplum jacket was beautifully made. Soft supple leather. Fit was spot on using their quide. Packed nicely and arrived sooner then expected. Highly worth the purchase.
331,"I recently purchased some beautiful leather driving gloves and I am so happy! The leather is soft, supple, and high quality. I read many other reviews that recommended buying a size smaller than normal since the gloves run large and I am glad I took that advice. I will definitely be ordering From this shop again."
332,I loved the jacket. It fits well and I can move around it easily. I'm 5.7 and usually wear XL. I bought an XL leather jacket. I can zip it all the way up and still have room to move freely. But for me another size up would have given me extra comfort. I would like to add the shipping time didn't take long either.
333,The leather jacket I purchase was true to size I follow the recommendations Fan jacket shared with me and I like the fit. the smell of leather still remain on it even after 3 weeks of wear. and for the price and discount you can't go wrong. Delivery wasn't long but its worth the wait. Just make sure you put all the information correctly. Much appreciated stay safe all.
334,I have purchased four jackets (leather and lambskin) from Fan Jackets. My last jacket arrived in a shedded package and the internal jacket packaging was bent. I inspected the jacket and there was no damage. I took photos and sent them to Fan Jackets for their review. I will continue to purchase from Fan Jackets as the quality and pricing of their jackets are great.
335,"I order the men's rip black cotton trucker jacket in a xl which is my normal size ,but I  had to return it as it fit a little tight , Jasper was great in customer service and they shipped out my 2xl right away and I  received it within 5 days and it fits prefect , I am very happy with the jacket but I would suggest to order it in a size up. thanks again for the great customer service Fanjackets !!"
336,"My experience ordering from your company was exceptional. Your app., made the fitting of my size very easy, my order was shipped quickly and the fit and quality of the jacket was outstanding. I thank you and your team for a job well done. I look forward to doing more business with your company in the near future."
337,"I ordered the wrong size. Even after checking the sizing charts I wasn't sure since I had recently lost weight.The exchange was painless and way better than expected. I received a response within 24 hours, the return label arrived and the exchange was fast and without any additional cost. I also received a discount code for my next purchase! The Jacket I received is top quality, and I'm very happy with it. Great communication and a great company to do business with."
338,"I bought a beautiful white coat in medium.  Should have bought a small but will get alterations.  Just for reference I am 5'2' 115 but with a 36 "" chest so that why I purchased medium.  So look at the way the coat is made to see if you should size up..normally I do size up but this time I should have sized down.  I have bought from Fan Jackets several times know and loved all of purchases."
339,Great experience! I will be using this company again.   This was a Christmas gift that I ordered early because I didn’t know if I had the right size. Upon getting it my friend lovvvvved the jacket but did need a different size.  The return was so easy and they sent a new jacket as soon as they got the old one back.  It was quite fast.  My person loves the jacket and the quality is great.  It even has the hoodie that was a must!
340,"we purchaced a leather blazer, to replace ours that got misplaced, we asked them if we ordered one if it didn,t fit would they supply return label they agreed, so we took a chance were we don,t buy cloths on line, we got the jacket fit perfect nice leather it was about the same as our 30 year old one had all the inside pockets like our original  over satisfied with- don,t be scared when ordering, you should be happy donny"
341,"The design of MINOAR's clothing impresses in photographs, and thankfully the material and workmanship more than satisfies in person as well. Their customer service is excellent, giving fast and very personal feedback and assistance. Since it can be such a gamble, I typically hesitate to purchase clothing online. I am glad to took the risk with MINOAR, and if you find yourself enjoying their aesthetic, I highly recommend you give them a chance."
342,"I have ordered several times from Minor.Love the design, quality and service.Feels like wearing an unique clothes"
343,"My experience with Minoar was very good , professional team, professional service, unique exceptional personalized items , the quality they provide is amazing! I purchased two cardigans and two pants and was very satisfied of my choice. I will surely do it again. FOR THE ONE WHO DOES NOT BELONG . Good work Minoar team . God bless 🙏🏻"
344,"Anxiously awaited my first order from Minoar - the Duality Skirt - after seeing various OOTD from a TikTok content creator who raved about Minoar. Totally understand why - WOW!  The skirt is gorgeous! So well made and material is so luxurious! Unlike any cotton I’ve ever experienced - almost like suede! Even unpackaging was an experience! The skirt was wrapped so beautifully in a cloth pouch and came with a personalized note… it’s the little details for me! 🤌🏽🤌🏽Was sad that skirt was too big and I couldn’t wear immediately! (ordered a large but runs a little big maybe ?? I and 5’2, 155#, apple shaped) -  But even Minoar’s Customer service was impeccable; prompt response and easy exchange!! Love it! Wish all online retailers were like this!! Will DEFINITELY be shopping Minoar again 🖤🖤🖤PS: if you’re concerned about pricing - just know that these items are truly impressive, well made, classic pieces that will likely withstand time if cared for properly!! And anyways fast fashion may be cheap but it sucks and doesn’t last!"
345,"Minoar has been one of my favorite brands to shop with for years now. Every order is well packaged and organized. Their return and exchange processes are very streamlined, their customer service representatives are kind and quick to respond, and their prices are more than reasonable for the quality you're receiving. Cannot recommend them enough!"
346,"Great clothes, fun designs, good quality fabric.Being an online website, its hard to gauge what fits and doesnt. I selected xl on every item and sizes were inconsistent upon reception.But overall, shipping was fast, no issues, customer service was helpful and handled size exchange quickly. Strong recommend."
347,"Nice clothes, nice store, nice customer service! Will be coming back!"
348,"Minoar is the kind of experience you hope for as a traveler and explorer, especially when that exploration goes beyond the immediate surroundings and way into the realm of ideas, approaches and philosophies. Minoar is a unique place. I will always treasure my experience of discovering the store and meeting the brilliant minds behind it. A rare place that allows you to discover bits of yourself by exploring theirs."
349,Not only is Minoars clothing uniquely cool it’s well-made too Staff are quick to respond to emails In a super professional friendly manor Definitely a customer for life Fred j
350,"Its the best community . You can always ask for a question or something about the things you want to know and they will be there for you. The quality is non other than perfect the designs are out of this world and you can be sure that it wont change it'll get even better because they care about the things ,every small detail . Dont hesitate and order free you wont be disappointed. Trust the MINOAR family."
351,"I’m so glad my boyfriend found this website and sent me a link to one of the skirts I ended up buying. I was searching for modular, dystopian skirts for a couple of weeks and these are exactly that! I love both of the skirts I got because — they’re unique. It’s so hard to find modular clothing on the market, especially fully adjustable pieces like this. Plus the silhouette is sick! Some things they could improve on are smoothness of the skirts (maybe a soft thin lining to enhance comfortability?) + more skirts AND pants/shorts available in white :)"
352,"My experiences with the Atelier has been stellar, with my latest order being the cherry on top. Will stick around this brand for a long long time 🔥"
353,"Service client fantastic, team adorable (Yoan, Tea, Alek, Radko and the rest of the team), I would like to thank again an amazing experience into the Minoar atmosphere I found myself more and more into their conception of the dark wear, which I spent a lot of time on the phone with them, it's priceless.Their garments it made with love and care is not like any clothing I could find in a different independent brand, this is the little difference change everything like the internal pocket cut in diagonal, it needs to think about this,  especially their signature the fiber bond technique is unique another avant-garde.Keep working hard team :)"
354,Minoar has been my go-to designer since 2017.   The customer service and quality of the clothing is exquisite.
355,"This company makes apparel outside of the high speed fashion industry, creating garments that will last and make lasting impressions whenever, wherever, and however you wear them.I started building a Minor wardrobe many years ago now, and I still love all the pieces I own. My most recent purchase was an Aspect face mask, it's such a great piece of headwear, unlike anything I've seen before. It's stunning!The company is run by passionate people who really interact with their clients, they are responsive and happy to help whenever you reach out. The handling of an order is swift, almost all my orders have arrived within a week (International shipping). Far quicker than what you normally expect when ordering anything really."
356,"Amazing quality, design and reliable service!This is a brand that will become a fashion powerhouse in Europe, the quality is 5 stars and the originality is out of this world!"
357,"Minoár is a dream come true for men and artists who always struggled to find original design clothes at affordable price. I ordered several pieces of clothing from them and always had excellent experience: these folks never disappoint! Shipping is free & light-speed fast, usually takes 2-3 days max across countries. Quality from materials, to style and packaging is top-notch. Appearance is even better than what advertised on-site, their clothes make you stand out from the crowd without being over-the-top. Several friends already asked where do I get all these cool top-wears from. Last but not least, their customer service responds in minutes and takes excellent care of your issues. I've always hated writing review, and yet - this avant-garde brand deserves some solid kudos. Rock on!"
358,"I placed my order on Tuesday, and it arrived that Friday. From halfway across the world! I love the book, and I’m definitely making a purchase here again!"
359,"Love your style, the items come in a nice pouch, i will definitely come back for more!"
360,Superb quality and fantastic service (e.g. quick shipment turnaround).
361,I browse the internet to find some new cloth. I suddenly see their advertisement. I click the website and see the dress. its quality is just awesome. I highly recommended to my friend and family to visit this store when they come to this country.
362,"I bought a jacket with $25 off as a promotion. Turns out I needed a size up. Rather than chance missing out on the next size up as part of the return/exchange process, I just bought it. And then sent the smaller size back for a refund. Four issues. 1) I lost the $25 off in the process 2) the jacket had tailor’s chalk near the buttonholes 3) I had to pay for returning it 4) the larger size jacket did not include a storage bag. It is a high quality jacket, but the experience was mundane."
363,"The super fast shipping makes buying over the web from Haspel faster and less time consuming, where I live, than getting into the car, battling traffic, and finding out the store has a limited selection of the seersucker I want. Too bad I don't live in New Orleans"
364,I am very happy with my white linen jacket. Very well made and fit perfectly...something not always the case when ordered online. I had to replace another white linen jacket that had been damaged (from a different supplier). The Haspel jacket was a better design and came in a very timely manner.
365,I paid $200 for an item and didn’t receive it. Called the company and they are not willing to replace or refund my money.   They said it’s not our responsibility that you didn’t receive your order. SHAMEFUL!
366,"I can only rate on my experience THIS time around.I ordered a pair of bucks, to have expeditiously, paying accordingly.Day I was to have them was called by someone at Haspel to say they weren’t coming due to an imperfection in product—A nice gesture as it was appreciated, of course.But was a necessary item for an event and I had to do without."
367,Haspel has been doing it right for over 100 years. They are my 'go to' for Summer weight suits. Can't beat the timeless fashion but definitely can beat the heat and look good too. Great customer service. Prompt deliveries 5 of out 5 starts for me.
368,"The first suit I ordered didn't fit, scarcely a surprise for an initial Internet clothing purchase. The return process was smooth as glass, and I was graciously led through it, although had I been paying better attention I could have figured it out for myself based on the clear online instructions.I immediately purchased a replacement, as I was concerned it might sell out, and within days had received my refund, plus the difference in price between the suits. The replacement suit arrived quickly. I now know my size for subsequent purchases."
369,You can go to high street; and find a tailor; and be fitted for a bespoke suit.  You can order a Haspel jacket;  have it delivered in a couple of days; and lay out four Benjamins.  Your choice.  I like summer. I like seersucker.  I like ordering my size; and getting my size — my American size.  You will too.
370,"I love Haspel clothes but two significant issues.  Your men’s slack sizes are off.  I wear 33w-34w pants in every other manufacturer and even your 36w are tight.  Also, how can a New Orleans based clothier specializing in seersucker run out of blue seersucker pants in May?  That’s just not good."
371,"I love my new black seersucker suit. The fit, the flex, the coolness!!! Wow! Can’t wait until the Chickory Brown comes back in stock. The custom service is a wow too! Answered any questions I had and delivery was exceptional as well. The only reason I gave four stars was because of cost. Yup, I paid for it and will again, but it hurts the pocket a bit for a seersucker suit."
372,"Per current practice of online shopping, I had to order a few different sizes of the same item to get the right fit.  But it's a nice evening jacket in seersucker, and other items. Haspel customer service was personable and efficient."
373,Great product. Limited inventory and service is lacking. I ordered a great suit. Jacket fit great and pants did not. Sent pants back to get larger size. Larger size not available. Pants credited. Jacket for suit useless without pants. Not possible to talk to a person when calling their number. No response to e-mails requesting info when larger pants will be available. Sent jacket back too. May reorder when sizes are available. Thanks.
374,Received jacket as expected.  Great condition.  High quality.  Well presented.  Perfect size. Got compliments.  Will order from Haspel again ! Thank you!
375,"I ordered my shirt knowing that the first order can be a bit of a gamble.  The shirt was amazing, but it could not quite contain my lifter's physique in spots.  Exchanged for the next size up, and the process went smoothly and quickly.  I will definitely be a return customer."
376,"Compliments to Jenn for being such a strong C/S rep.Placed an order for 2 shirts. Shipped to wrong address (UPS) fault.Neighbor left pkg. at my door the next afternoon after I had received a notethat it had been delivered.Opened pkg.  one shirt good, the other wrong color.Called C/S and was shipped the right color and arrived prior to our leave for acruise.  Will place another order on return and insist that I be billed for the 3rd. shirt that I have worn and will keep.ThaksMike Dickerson,    Cumming,  Ga."
377,I received the wrong pair of shoes. Will called me immediately which I appreciated a lot instead of getting an email. I told Will I  would keep the other shoes and he offered a discount on the replacement shoes again appreciated very much and shipped them out immediately. Again the fast response was excellent and you now have a regular customer in me.
378,"Thank you, Will!!! Your patience and perseverance with the perfect fit of the pin cord was customer service beyond expectations. You made it happen!! So grateful!"
379,"Better than expected. Ordered a size up for my husband so that we could tailor it to fit. Pant legs were slightly to slim on him, so if you have an athletic build be mindful that you will likely need to have the pants taken out. Shipping was super fast."
380,Quality shorts. Easy exchange
381,Very well made and constructed. Helpful dialogue with Seema to improve on fit from previous orders. Excellent result. Thansk
382,"My experience with Luxire is incredible. Their customer service is exceptional as is their execution and craftsmanship. I have acquired quiet a few pairs of trousers. In my pursuit to have the perfect silhouette, I have revisited luxire for alteration of my existing pair and they have always done it for free, in addition based on picture references I shared, they even modified the measurements, all remotely. I cannot stop buying from them, given the incredible experience I am having."
383,I've been buying pants from Luxire for about 3 months now. I had to go through some trial and error for fitting but my last pair was perfect and I will continue to purchase from Luxire for many years to come.Thank you
384,"Email consultation is almost perfect.(fit advice or any questions)I’m bewildered by how Luxire could put so much effort into 1:1 email conversation with a customer.Actually I feel somewhat apologetic when I ask too many and long questions, to which Luxire always kindly answers."
385,Good experience with the first pair of trousers. Some adjustments had to be made after the first try-on but Luxire agreed to take care of that (as much as can be done). Still some finetuning to be done on the next pair but I am happy with the first pair and will certainly order again.
386,Luxire for the perfect Ghurka pants !Top fit en cloth !!!Jan van den Donk
387,"NOT based in Munich. Ordered some trousers that were sent from Asia. Be prepared that if you order here you will need to pay additional custom costs. Pants are too small, recommendation would be 1-2 sizes bigger for average europeans."
388,I really enjoy working with Luxire. The MtM can be a bit costly at first but Luxire helping me out with fine tuning with every single order and offered me quite a lot of discounts throughout my journey until we finally got to a fit where I'm very comfortable. The workmanship is absolutely beautiful and so are the fabrics and fit (obviously). COMMUNICATION is KEY.
389,"Wonderful experience ordering from Luxire. The customer service (I corresponded with Seema) is prompt, detail-oriented, and helpful. I ordered a custom pair of corduroy high-waisted trousers and the quality and fit is exceptional. No other retailer allows for so much customization without exorbitant costs! I will definitely be ordering more from them."
390,"Very poor experience. I ordered a pair of pants that were made very far off from the measurements promised. Luxire did not admit any fault and offered to ""remake"" the pants if I paid an additional $75. Absolutely the worst experience I have had and will not ever recommend them to anyone."
391,"I'm a Luxire customer since 2013. Luxire provide my favourite shirts and trousers in consistent quality at an unbeatable price. On top of that we have undertaken many special orders together like a two-piece suit, tuxedo, leather office bag, cableknit cardigan, overcoat and much more, that turned out fantastic.I can recommend anyone to start with a trial shirt / trousers or send in a garment for replication. Anyways, you can't go wrong with any of their options as long as you precisely specify every detail from your imagination.Whereas turnaround time has been slow in the early years, these days all my orders arrive in Germany within 1-2 weeks which is insane for custom clothing.Even my girlfriend has started ordering her shirts at Luxire and she is going to try trousers soon too."
392,"I have now ordered several shirts and pairs of trousers from Luxire. The lead time is very short, and the garments themselves have all been of a very high quality. The Luxire staff with whom I have spoken have also been very attentive and helpful. I have no hesitation in recommending Luxire wholeheartedly."
393,"Luxire is a truly amazing company! I was recently in search of a custom pair of denim jeans and was able to pick everything I wanted and upload my measurements to luxires website. The pants shipped in 3 days, arrived 7 days later and fit perfectly. I highly recommend them. Definitely make sure if you submit your own measurements that you do them right."
394,"I’ve been a Luxire customer for several years. Fabrics, craftsmanship and prices are great. I have previously had some communication issues but that has been very much improved. It may take a couple of iterations to nail the fit, but with these prices you can’t complain. They are also very helpful with giving fit adjustments based on pictures of previous orders. I’ve tried more expensive MTM services with in person fittings but they cannot compete with Luxire in terms of price and delivery times."
395,"Firstly, the Solbiati stone grey linen is a great fabric.The design of the trousers was based on the Armani shape of the early '80s, looser, with a ""round leg"" shape, which was driven by the style of the pleat.Rather than the traditional forward / backward 1 or 2 pleats, this was a box pleat, as you might find on the back of a shirt.I sent a series of emails explaining what I wanted, together with pictures primarily from old Armani ad campaigns. I am pleased to say that Luxire produced a very good copy of an unusual design. One I doubt any of them had seen before"
396,Great website and customer service. Very speedy manufacturing and delivery. I have ordered several pants and am very satisfied: high quality fabrics and near perfect fit (which for me is almost unheard of). I’m definitely going to order from Luxire again!
397,"Luxire has once again been the best service I’ve used. They are quick, knowledgeable and dedicated to helping you achieve the exact fit and look you seek. I’ve now ordered five pants from Luxire for my wardrobe and loved every interaction along every step of the way. They are one of the best companies I’ve had to pleasure to work with and see who I plan to outfit the remainder of my trousers for fall/winter with. Even when mistakes occurred due to my own miscommunication they were happy to correct the issue and promptly set to making sure everything was correct."
398,"My first order with Luxire-a pair of trousers in VBC flannel.   From reading online reviews, I half expected to have trousers travel backwards and forwards halfway round the world before the fit was right. No, the fit was great. I used their online guide, measured two pairs I have that fit well and hey presto great fitting new pair. Now here's the fantastic bit...delivered in around a week!! Comms was great throughout-I had some specific requests, rapid response and the guys did as they said they would.  Would not hesitate at all to order from Luxire again."
399,"Fantastic made-to-measure service. Ordered a custom pair of navy linen trousers that was made and delivered within a week (to the Netherlands). Lots of customisation options. Unfortunately, my submitted measurements were slightly off so Seema from customer service kindly offered me a discounted remake. Great customer service that takes care of you and makes sure you get the best experience, both in terms of communication and fit. Can also highly recommend the high-waisted ready-to-wear trousers that have a classic fit, opposed to the slim-fit trousers that you find on high street."
400,"The whole process was great and the communication was very smooth over the email. The product turned out even better than I expected. The only negative thing was the extra charges, about 100 USD, I had to pay upon delivery, for the import in to the EU."

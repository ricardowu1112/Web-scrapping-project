5,The shirts are awesome at a reasonable price. Design and quality are also unique..
6,"Loved your products, highly satisfied with your quality."
7,Good product quality and fast delivery :D
8,Awsum products with intime delivery
9,"These goods are superb and do not appear to be inexpensive. The cloth is thick and pleasant to the touch, much better than I expected for the price, and it arrived quickly. Very comfy and well-fitting."
10,STAY AWAY.  Don‚Äôt trust these fake reviews.  The pants are the worst quality I‚Äôve ever bought.  They arrived missing a belt loop and with a hole in the left pocket.  The material feels like cheap 1970s plasticky polyester.  Man did I fall for the slick marketing and fake reviews.  This is bad Chinese garbage.
11,Ordered stretch trousers 40 in waist 33 leg when they finally arrived honestly they are more like 36 waist and 28 leg with about 1 mm stretch just chucked straight in the bin cba to send back.Just order from amazon 100% reliability and its EASY to return
12,I got the wrong color of pants and they have one of the poorest customer support services I have ever experienced. They still haven‚Äôt properly addressed the mistake even though I have been messaging them via different channels. Makes it seem like a one man operation.
13,"The design of the pants is really modern which is great for business wear. The fabric is firm and durable even if you try stretching it out, it still goes back into place. A great deal for such quality pants."
14,"Extremely cheap material and 2/10 workmanship. You‚Äôre not only wearing plastic, you‚Äôre wearing something that looks and feels plastic. This can be bought at discount shops for $25 here, but it‚Äôs worth $5-10 max.Let this be the first real review since the others obviously look fake (posted around the same date, reviewers have only 1 review on their account and they have no further reviews on the company page since the fake ones were posted).This isn‚Äôt the only deceit these people participate in. Their ‚Äúfounders picture‚Äù on the website is a stock image. There is no address listed on their site and the product is shipped from China. This leads me to conclude this is a knockoff dropshipping brand with false advertising and marketing. I‚Äôll be reporting them to the FTC in the usa and whatever the european version of that is for false claims and fake reviews. Furthermore I‚Äôll report them to facebook when they ask me to fill in the post purchase survey."
15,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE GUYS, THEY ARE A SCAM! Took my money, waited 4 weeks, emailed them and they said they would send me a new shipping order and never heard from them again. Report them as fraud to your bank and you should get your money back"
16,"When the shirts arrived - very quickly in fairness to them - I was very pleased. The quality seemed good. However, 2/3 washes later the shirts are beginning to fall apart. Having raised my issue with jersey loco I was told that I was washing them incorrectly!! Great customer service guys!!! I wash the kit if a junior football team every week so I know what I am doing!!$100 down the drain. Avoid like the plague‚Ä¶:if you want to buy crap fakes go elsewhere."
17,"Good luck to get refunded.Phoned at least 5x, 1st time spoke to someone who said someone would call back, never happened. The 4 other times, answering machine full.Wrote many times, useless.Quality was more than fine but size was not appropriate.I paid to have my package sent back to me if no recipient, never happened either."
18,"Do NOT order Jerseys from this website. I've yet to receive my jersey order and it has been 4 months.- I purchased a jersey from Jersey Loco on June 23rd, and paid for express shipping, hoping to receive it in time to start my soccer season. - On June 26th, they contacted me to advise that they were unable to provide express shipping and that they only had their standard shipping available. As I needed this jersey as soon as possible, I requested that my order be cancelled and refunded in its entirely, on the same day that they contacted me. - On June 30th, I reached out to them for a follow up as I had not received a confirmation or acknowledgement from their part. - On July 1st, they replied and advised that this would be escalated to management. - I followed up with them on July 6th and then again on July 11th, with no response, and I am yet to hear from them. The funds have been debited from my credit card and I have not received my item, nor have a I received a response or a tracking number."
19,"Order number 69604.  I am going through the same frustration as others with no action being taken by the company to resolve my problems. Emails, messengers, phone calls and no responses.  I have sent them another email advising them they have 7 days to resolve my problem or I will be taking further action. Please avoid this company!"
20,"Received an incomplete order. Sended an email 3 times, without any answer. Still missing one shirt."
21,"We ordered a Hoffenheim jersey months ago. Funny how fast they took our money but they never delivered the jersey. We filed a fraud complaint with our bank and let JerseyLoco know. All of a sudden, they have offered a jersey of our choice if we withdraw the complaint and send them copies of the withdrawal letter which we did. Guess what? Still no jersey. Be very careful when ordering from them."
22,"BE ADVISED!!! Do NOT order from this website.  Unfortunately, I have had to turn them into the BBB and now my bank is investigating them for fraud. I placed an order in July 2. It‚Äôs September 12th and I still don‚Äôt have the merchandise or refund. After 20+ emails, all I get is 2  emails stating sorry my emails went to spam & your order has been shipped out. A tracking number will follow in a couple days. But yet‚Ä¶.still no tracking number or merchandise.  Again, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!"
23,I bought the home Crystal Palace jersey 21/22 as it was no longer available in the UK in my size. I received the product with no issue and was initially happy with the product. But after a few days I could tell that some of the detail is off. The badge is not straight and slightly bigger and not as bright as the original on the away 21/22 Jersey and other jerseys I have. Also the Pantone colour is the wrong on the sponsor. The website says they are original but it is clear they are just quite good fakes.
24,I have been waiting for 30 of June to till now 28 of August sending email after email with always they say track your order tired more than 30 times and I can't track it again live chat same track your order always same response a call to California international call from Europe to words us you don't really talk to no one just a pre massage saying pls leave you number we will call you which I find weird trying to look at there policy on web site live chat. Keeps popping up with no live agent I keep getting login out for no reason to the point I want nothing to do with them a want a refund was looking at polecy where should I go? Pls help
25,"They sent me a false tracking number and then reply that the item was probably lost and that they can send me again but then nothing, no answers. In fact they replied me telling my email was in spam accidentally but then when I ask for a refund they never answered again‚Ä¶"
26,"Ordered 30.6. 22 , 2 jerseys. Never delivered. Apparently all my emails went to spam. Today 18.8. 22 still nothing delivered. Never got tracking number. Will go to the bank a try to get the money back as this is 100% spam"
27,I previously wrote that this is a scam site and still believe. After my first review they pretended to contact me to follow up on my order. Needless to say nothing further happened !Ordered in March and still nothing to show for it. Don‚Äôt do it is my advise. The good reviews are likely fakes !!You have been warned - do not use them !!!
28,"They missed one jersey in my 3 for $100 order, two arrived 2 weeks after the order, 1 was missing. I sent them 3 emails, and in 4 weeks not a single reply, no customer service what so ever. So if you do order something you better hope everything is ok because if anything is wrong no one will bother to help you. Jerseys are ok, you can see it is not original, very good copies, but that why are those prices. And that is if you get everything what you ordered."
29,"Having bought the genuine Nike home and away kits from official retaliers for my son here in the UK, the team's third kit was out of stock in my son's size. Unfortunately when the kit arrived it is obviously a fake. The quality of the material, logos and personalisation used are all obviously fake in comparison to the genuine kits bought from the club shop. Even the sizing of the sponsors logo and name set are all off.If you think you are purchasing a genuine official item, think again."
30,"First time ever purchasing a product from them and was hesitant at first. Price seemed to good to be true. Decided on buying a Ajax kit since my local store was out of stock. Took about 2 weeks to receive (California). But definitely worth the wait! Even took the kit to my local shop to compare the quality. Must I say, besides being perfect quality with a visual comparison, I will no longer be shopping elsewhere but from this company!"
31,"Ordered 2 different jerseys, and they accidentally sent me 2 of the same. That can happen, no problem, but i emailed them several times and tried to call them and there is no way to get in touch with them. They dont respond to email and they dont pick up the phone. Therefore i am very unhappy with this company and i will advice anyone against doing business with them."
32,The company requested for additional info so here goes. I ordered 3 jerseys on 06/08/2022 with order number 59022 for the sum of $120.47 before taxes but got 2 delivered. Numerous emails have gone unanswered. Phone goes to voicemail regardless of ehen you call. Won't respond to chats.
33,"I ordered 3 jerseys and paid over 100 dollars on June 1st, June 15th says my order/shipping cancelled or exceptional delay occurred or cancellation. I really don‚Äôt know what an exceptional delay could be so today is June 28 and I still don‚Äôt have my items. I send them three messages and they did not respond me at all I ended up finally claim with my bank to get my money back I would absolutely not recommend this website you‚Äôre better off paying a little bit more price and buying from a trusted company."
34,There is currently a problem with the shipping for ny order and my package's in China since about 1 1/2 month and when i ask them for some more information on my order they dont actually help me so F YOU JERSEY LOCO bunch of scammers
35,"I'm in the USA. I had doubts about ordering. Yes, it takes a bit longer for the product, but....when I opened the package, it was worth the wait. the quality is excellent, the fit is as well. All the complaints are delivery and odd things, but no complaints on the quality of the product. OK, it isnt made in the USA, what is. it ships fast, but it doesn't arrive in two days, so what. I highly reccomoent AAA."
36,It been a month since i order some Amir black jeans. Sad things is that I spent almost 100 dollars on some damn jeans. I try to refund it back it wouldn‚Äôt let me so whoever buys from this Website. Do not do it! It a scam everyone it sad people still out here scamming our community and culture. Somebody need to get rid of this website or report it
37,If I could give a review of 0 I would. First off they are not in California as the website says. This F‚Äôn scam company is in China! I‚Äôve been waiting weeks for my order and the site says your order will ship in a few days. I will never never ever buy a f‚Äôn thing from this company ever again. Save your money and buy somewhere else!
38,"Ordered on December 18th and received my order on January 11th. Keep in mind we're still in a pandemic so having stuff shipped from China to America is gonna take longer than what you want to expect. Got my hoodie the way I wanted it, they'll get back to you when you email them for reassurance. You just got to have patience and it'll be there before you know it. 5 stars!"
39,"Ordered a shirt on Jan 12, 2022 for a Tool concert on Feb 5. Supposed to arrive by the 27th. It‚Äôs been ‚Äúin my city‚Äôs mail carrier‚Äù since the 23, but it says it‚Äôs cancelled. Despite the money being taken from my account as soon as I bought it. and the phone number on the website gives me a custom garage company in California."
40,Ordered a Guns N Roses hoodie on January 13 and just got it today and it was some Spanish hoodie. Not what I ordered. Tried calling the number from the site and could tell it was a scam site so just wanted to to leave a review to not order anything from this site. You WILL GET RIPPED OFF!!!
41,They are definitely a scam just call the numbers they give....one is for a garage door company and the other is some old white lady that told me she gets 30 calls a day about packages and have no clue what is going on. Now she just answer and say you have been scammed. The good reviews on here are people that are in on the scam!!! Let's figure out how to get the FBI onto this company trail
42,I went online on 12/7/2021 and ordered a Formula 1 Lewis Hamilton bomber style jacket.  I kept a PDF of the online order.  I got no other correspondence from Ahashirt.  I could look up the order for two weeks on their website and then it disappeared.  It did show in production before disappearing.  The jacket showed up on 1/2/2022 and looked exactly as advertised.  I never received an acknowledgement email of my order.  So I had no idea if or when it would arrive.  Their customer email and phone numbers go unanswered.
43,"IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED,  THIS SO CALLED COMPANY AHASHIRTS IS BOGUS!!!! ORDERED SOMETHING IN 10/ 21 , ITS NOW 12/ 21....WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY FROM THEM. THEY EMAILED ME A GENERIC RESPONSE THAT YOU CAN TELL IS FROM OVERSEAS WITH BROKEN ENGLISH. THATS DEFINITELY NOT HOW COMPANIES DO ANYTHING."
44,"I‚Äôve shopped with this page a total of 5 times first two times went extremely smooth, three times after were hell multiple times they didn‚Äôt even email back until days later , multiple times they couldn‚Äôt tell me where my actual packages were now I just purchased from them yesterday now they‚Äôre telling me they don‚Äôt have my payment and I have 3 transactions proving I paid for my item it will definitely be the last time I waste my money here"
45,"If I can rate them 0 I would proper scam artists, I placed order on 26 September worth ¬£136, still haven‚Äôt received it, I have tried numerous times to contact them at first they were replying, and now they have stopped, seems like they‚Äôve took my money and not post anything out to me, just ignoring me now AVOID AVOID AVOID they will take your money and not send anything"
46,As of today 07/22/20 I havent heard from them. Paid $21.00 for DHL shipping (6-8 days) but Nothing yet almost 20 days later I have no idea what happened to my order. They sent me a tracking number wich dont show me NOTHING about the status of my order. also emailed them and havent gotten any answers(Order ID: 8995747Date Added: 10/07/2020Your order has been updated to the following status:All Shipped)
47,"This is my second order from them and they always deliver...if an item is out of stock I am contacted to pick another or the money is kept in credit for next order. delivery is always on time, quality is top grade. I like them and their customer service experience is very quick and polite. I will definitely patronise them again and again."
48,"Less than a month for my order to get to me and the quality is amazing down to the last stitch. I was a little concerned with some of the other reviews that I read, but I am no longer.¬† I found my new spot to shop, look great without breaking the bank. The best find for me in YEARS!THANK YOUS.L."
49,"I am very happy with my purchase with them.  It was a very good service and the delivery took around 5 days! Dock is the fastest delivery I have received from everything I bought from China.I knew I could trust AAAshirt. I will definitely buy more from them  and I recommend them to you who love brand clothes and stuff, it really good products better than DHgate anyway. Thank you AAAshirt!"
50,"I have bought from AAA over 6 times now. They respond on email in reasonable time for drastically different time zones. They have never sent me a defective product or the wrong product. All products are high quality and I can‚Äôt tell much a difference from actual REAL designer products I own. Any shipping logistics delays were Covid-19 related, my last shipment was complete within 2 weeks from order to delivery. I highly recommend AAA, the quality really is outstanding."
51,"An absolute horrible site to purchase from. They charge you $50 -$70 dollars for 5-7 day service, but need 30-45 days to process your order.  CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION.  I may not even recieve my order.  I will keep you posted...Today I reached out again with no response.. 4 or 5 emails every day until I  paid for my merchandise.. now not a single response."
52,"I was initially reluctant to place the order having read so many negative things about this company but decided to give it a try so I ordered eight shirts totalling ¬£310. I‚Äôm so glad I did, not only was the quality very good, I received all the eight shirts within one week. They surpassed my expectations and I would be placing more orders with them."
53,"Great communication,  Q's answered almost immediately.  Unlike other orders from PRC it had accurate constant tracking,  polo shirts arrived by USPS delivery four days after leaving the company!   For US customers,  ask which size translates.  If you wear XL with room to spare,  order an AAASHIRT  3-XL.   If its tight,  search for a 4-XL.  I found very few."
54,"I ordered a custom jersey on December 5th. It arrived 5 weeks later. It was a pittsburg steelers jersey and was sent to me in navy blue and yellow colors! I asked for a refund seven times. I asked them to cancel the order on the 3rd week. Instead of cancelling the order and issuing a refund, they shipped it anyways and then asked me to send a photo of the jersey so they could check it out. I did. Then they sent another email requesting a couple more photos in a different light! Besides making the customer jump through hoops to prove they received a defective item, especially when they received a request before they shipped it to cancel the order since it was late, I have discovered through reading these reviews that the company is fraudulent."
55,"To start off I bought off aaabrands.ru which is basically the same site just more options. The site is not a scam they do deliver the products you purchased and you can actually pay through PayPal which has a buyer protection. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but this was my first time buying from them and was a little skeptical from seeing all the negative reviews left, I just wanted to confirm the site was legit for anyone who was scared to order.  Only thing to keep in mind is the sizes are off if u are a male xl I would order 2xl other then that it is a good site for cheap brand name clothes."
56,I ordered over a 300 euro worth of stuff that I never got they said it was signed by a fella called David that‚Äôs not me and then didn‚Äôt help inanyway to try help me so was left with no goods and people waiting on them would never shop again with them
57,Alright. People. Things take a while to get to you. These guys do NOT scam. They get back to your emails the next day. I've ordered from these guys dozens of times and had nothing but great experiences. I trust them 100%.
58,"Had over 10+ orders from this site now and all products always perfect and delivery is between 7-14 days, think the longest I have waited was 21 days but that was due to COVID being at its peak, will be ordering from this site in the future"
59,"Fast shipping , into EU. Very fast custom service. Good looking product. One negative better shipping price before but know that Covid messing up shipping! Coming soon back"
60,I ordered twice from this website I don't know what everybody else talkin about but I got everything I ordered and the second time I ordered I spent a little bit more money and still got my order within 7 days I think they are good
61,"Hello,I need an update on this order number please?8995450I ordered on July 8th and should‚Äôve received it in 5-7days however I have not received anything  including a tracking number. I needed these items urgently as to why I chose DHL shipping. Please let me know when I will receive this, when it will be shipped or how I can go about cancelling my Order. Thank you.Update: based on how things goes with this, I might write a new review.Update: I received a tracking number when I asked to cancel my order. The tracking number cannot be pulled up on DHL website.I cannot access the website anymore from my phone. I sent another email to cancel the order. I‚Äôll update again."
62,"I bought at aaabrands.ru which i guess is the same but different store with a new website, The order took from payment to delivery about 9 days which is ok.After shipment i received a tracking number which wasnt working and so i got a bit nervous in the beginning. also the fact that they didnt replied on my second and third emails. but i am impatient in general so sitting tight and shut the f up would be maybe better, cause package arrived and quality is beyond expectations So its definitely worth waiting and also 8 days from hongkong to europe isnt that much of a biggie i guess. So the shop is very legit and i can recom it for sure. Maybe they could work on the tracking number thing to take me as a customer a bit more at peace but maybe it was also an onetime issue. will buy again for sure"
63,Omg! All I can say I'll be ordering again... My items were shipped fast ... looks just like description...very high quality... thanks so much ... im glad to be your customer...
64,"Brilliant service, package came quick considering. Customer service are helpful in providing tracking details and helping me out, will order again for sure."
65,"They are thieves, don't send your money to them, they are scammers. I ordered on May 7 they take the money on the next day, till now I received just excuses. Don't send your money.."
66,I bought two items at their website. Didn¬¥t receive anything and now two months later my creditcard got blocked by the bank because of 3 automatic charges on my cc from Russia.
67,"Such great quality products, and they are so responsive on email to any queries big or small. Ordering online can be nerve racking sometimes but this site really is great!"
68,"10/10 love them, they are a huge business with 100s if not 1000s of orders a day, they are good with there word. I appreciate doing business with them"
69,It has been 20 days and they still did not even ship my order !! every time i send an email they keep telling me 2 to 3 days and they will ship it ! very bad service.
70,I ordered for 259 dollars the 4th august and i never recieved anything. Today is the 14th december and I would love to get an update.(order number 8684633)
71,I have pleased a order and they sent me a email that is was out of stock so I wanted my mony back and til know I didn't receive my mony. Order id 8998483
72,"I ordered on january 5, and paid by credit card, nothing arrived, in 3 months. No answer with multiple requests by mail. Absolutely scam site. CAUTION CAUTION"
73,Don't let the bad reviews here get to you. This shop is amazing. I bought LV Shoes and shirts and I got them in less than a week. Will buy from them again.
74,I have ordered 3 items 2 bags and a pair of socks excellent quality and  prompt customer service. I will continue to order from this site
75,"Quick delivery, good follow-up and the article matchs the description."
76,I had a great experience buying from Zartoni.  The delivery time is acceptable and the product is of very good quality.I recommend it!
77,Awesome selection of men‚Äôs clothes.  Ordered a bomber jacket.  Took a little longer then I expected to arrive.  No big deal. The jacket was very nicely packaged and fits and looks great. Will be ordering again.  Trust the size chart if you decide to use this. Definitely two enthusiastic thumbs up üëç üëç
78,"Great product! I ordered a brown beanie from Zartoni, and it is incredible. Not only does it look great, it feels incredibly soft and warm. They will be one of my go-to companies for fashion. They have a diverse selection!"
79,"SCAMIf I could give zero ratings I would. Even with a tracking number, which I think is bogus, the item has still not arrived almost after 2 months. I would highly recommend everyone not to order from this scam of a company"
80,The item that I ordered a month ago still not delivered. They can‚Äôt even provide the information what delivery service is used for. The tracking show my item is delivered but the item that I ordered is not shown up.
81,"'Fraud' is the simplest way to describe what this company is doing.  I was not expecting much since the price of the items I purchased was surprisingly low, but what I finally received was no where close to the advertised items i thought I was buying. Moreover, sizing was wrong, the designs were different and the quality was non existent.  I do not know how companies like these get away with what they are doing!Stay away"
82,"I had a great experience with Zartoni. The quality of the shirts and fabric and style were excellent. I love their shirts and I will be buying some vests soon. My only 'critical' comment is that the delivery took longer than expected. But, here in Canada, everything is slowed down due to Covid. Otherwise, great job! I will be a repeat/continued customer. Thanks so much :)"
83,"THIS IS A SCAM!!! The jacket that i received seems very poorly made and the lable (brand) on the inside of the jacket is different to that on the photo. The Zartoni website says the clothes are Italian but you can see on the tracking page that the package ships out of shanghai. THE CLOTHES ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY CHEAP CLOTHES THAT ARE MADE IN CHINA AND MARKETED TO LOOK PREMIUM. You can also tell its a scam becasue the clothes are always ""on sale"". DO NOT SUPPORT!"
84,"I have called many times and always get a answering machine. I received an email, that I emailed back many times and still haven‚Äôt gotten a response on returning items. This a total scam and it‚Äôs very difficult to return items. This is extremely bad business and unprofessional. I expect a response back and will be doing a charge back on my credit card. I‚Äôll be reporting you to the Better Business Bureau if I don‚Äôt get a response back within three days. With so many bad reviews, I will succeed my outcome. My order number is 66634"
85,"Worst experience for e-commerce, ever.  I ordered a shirt, two ties, and two vests on 11 April.  A shirt and vest showed up and were definitely back ally stuff like at a street market in Bangkok.  Cheaply made. Smelly.  Wrapped in plastic.  Website pictures are scammed.  The other vest and ties have not shown-up...buyer beware!  Zartoni keeps sending a USPS tracking number that isn‚Äôt active."
86,"I order a coat and didn't care for the quality, so sent it back.  Getting information from them on how to send it back was pretty frustrating -- but I finally got the address (I had to pay for the return shipping myself).  They've had the return now for 3 weeks and still haven't issued a refund.  They keep asking me to wait a couple more days.  I filed a claim with PayPal so they can handle it and I'll get my money returned.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY."
87,"They claim to be Italian and ship things from Miami. The truth of the matter is they're cheap items from China. That's right, CHINA. Not Italy, but CHINA. Their size chart is so off that if you order anything from them I can guarantee it that they won't fit. And then good luck returning the items. The cost to return the cheaply made items will probably be more than the items themselves.STAY AWAY FROM ZARTONI. THEY ARE A COMPLETE SHAM AND SCAM."
88,"Christmas jumper, ordered on 13 Dec. Not told it would take weeks to arrive. When it did arrive (22nd jan - six weeks after ordering), it is way too big (small fits over 2 sweaters and I‚Äôm normally a medium anyway!). Quite a few loose fibres, knit is not very high quality. I would be fine with quality if size was good - it‚Äôs only a Christmas jumper after all. Sorry I don‚Äôt have anything more positive to add."
89,"Placed my order for 3 beanies December 2, 2019 and finally received a notification it was delivered December 23,2019. Checked my mailbox for days, no package was delivered, no note or notice in my mailbox. The company customer service is a joke, and Arrive tracking service customer service is non existent altogether.I feel I have been had by a scam and will never see the product I ordered. Buyers beware"
90,Zero star review.I ordered an item for $70 ended up paying $95 due to exchange rate fro USD to CAD and I still haven't received the the shipment yet !!! When I tried to contact them through their website I got an automated reply message with no helpful information.It is waste of time and money....I will call my credit card company to claim my money back.
91,The order was placed 19 business days ago and I've gotten some bootleg Chinese tracking about this order since then. I fear that this is an illegitimate company and that they have stolen my money and I'm contacting PayPal to get a full refund. Beware of this company... It is not an Italian company but it's based out of China and if you purchase anything from them and go get bizzare tracking information from China.
92,"I bought a beanie hat and bracelet from Zartoni at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the 2 items were shipped separately. The bracelet is leather but with cheap-feeling plastic rings on which was not clear in the description. The hat has been impounded by customs and I have to pay ¬£13 on top of the cost of the item which makes it the most expensive hat I have ever owned. I am very disappointed"
93,This place is pretty much a scam.  They billed me three times.  Of which I have not been returned.  So I was billed over $350 American. Never recieved any of my product.  Was in contact with them nermerous times and emails where sent saying I would receive my product and get my money back.  Nothing has happened and it‚Äôs been over 4 months now.  Sadly there is no one to call to report this business.  Don‚Äôt buy from them. Facebook should be vetting these advertisements.   Brutal!
94,"I read all the reviews and pretty much gave up thinking I got scammed.  BUT...it actually arrived today.  Ordered it on 12/9/19 and arrived 1/8/2020.  So it took one month.  It looks like what I ordered and feels and fits great.  Only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because it‚Äôs not made by Zartoni, or least it didn‚Äôt have the brand name on it, instead it has ‚ÄúHonghe‚Äù, not quite as sexy as Zarotni.  I just took off the tag and it looks great!"
95,"Ordered on November 14 on the recommendation of a friend who received a beautiful, comfortable beanie.  I ordered the same one and here I am two months later (with winter almost gone) and I still have not received anything.  I already sent one complaint about the shipment and no response.  Sent a second complaint as well today.  The shipment shows still sitting in GuangDongShengGuangZhouShi 51040034 | Despatch from Sorting Center since November 18."
96,"Horrible experience.  Each day the planned delivery date slips to the current date, but the item never gets delivered. This has happened the past 5 days.  Their own notification States that if it is not received within two days to contact them. After it not coming in 4 days after the stated delivery date, I contacted them using their own ""contact us"" hyperlink, and got an automated reply back stating that this email address is not monitored. What a joke."
97,As my title says: Do NOT buy from them.I did NOT receive anything from them except the order details and of course they took my money. Since then I didn't receive any update and when I contact them. They NEVER reply!! To add salt to the wounds. I just fell into their scam market on instagram and I just discovered this page now!!
98,"Zero stars! Place my order on April 13th, 2 pairs of pants and 2 sweaters. On May 3rd I sent in a ticket, they responded the next day claiming my order was in transit since April 28th. Just sent another one today and now I‚Äôm contacting my credit card to file a fraud. Brutal! Wish I knew about this site."
99,"I was waiting for my order for two weeks now without much of a progress. Got tracking number that looks like a dead end.Their customer service respond quite quick but their responses are predefined. Got tired and tried to cancel the order. Loved their response. Quote:‚Äú Unfortunately it's too late to change your order now. Rest assured, all our products are awesome! So, even though you‚Äôll be receiving a product that you would no longer like, we‚Äôre sure that you‚Äôll find a good use for it. ‚ÄúScam."
100,"Absolutely a scam. Clothing took three weeks to come, feels like dollar store quality, coming apart at the seams. There is nowhere on their site or in their emails to process a return. Happy to edit my review once a refund has been issued."
101,"I believe this is a scam company and it is no wonder big business like Amazon has taken over.  I ordered a beanie from Zartoni and the tracking was vague and stopped after about 3 weeks, so I wrote to the company. They said they resent it and gave a new tracking number and the tracking stopped again and I filled out another customer question ticket.  The told me there was a problem with the package getting to me and only refunded 11.99 of a 16.99 order.  I never received the product.  Ridiculous."
102,"Hi  Zartoni, I have bought a shirt from your site on the 29/1/21 at 9.23 AM Ref: 4029357733, Please check & Send  ASAP Its is more than a month otherwise I will request Master Card for a Refund. Thanks Joseph Dias 0417358483, 21 Dingley Ave, Dandenong"
103,I wish I could give this  company a ZERO. Haven't received my merchandise. Money taken from my account and customer service is just an automatic email response. Don't let them rip you off. Honestly this company should be reported to a higher establishment then a personal bank because they are a 100% SCAM.
104,0 star review. This may be a real business but you will not get your clothes within a month. I haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet and it‚Äôs been 4 weeks. They haven‚Äôt even shipped it yet. Bank won‚Äôt cancel my charge because it‚Äôs debit. Definitely use a credit card to buy from this place Incase they try to f*** you.
105,"The email listed under contact kicks back an automated response saying this email is not monitored and that you shouldn‚Äôt use it. My package hasn‚Äôt moved in 11 days, which is more a reflection of China Post, but Zartoni has been no help at all either. Just glad I got this item on sale. Never using them again."
106,Was very surprised to see so many bad reviews.  I ordered my beanie and love it.  The order does take some time but they did respond to me in a timely manner when I inquired.  I also received a discount for future purchases.  Keeping an open mind.  I like the style of the clothing and accessories.
107,Dont Buy at Zartoni!!!The company is scam in my eyes.I ordered a shirt about 5 weeks ago. Nothing happened except for the payment via paypal. You get a shipping link from a dubious Chinese post on which nothing happens.save your money and most importantly be careful with your credit card details
108,I purchased a white Lapis Dress (where it was slightly reduced) where I was still charged $42.90 / ¬£34.91! I ordered this item on the 6th October but where they didn't post it until the 27th of October. When it finally arrived on the 8th Nov I found the quality to be terrible with an iron on motif which was sticky. I have been told I can return it to China for an exchange of store coupon as I am not allowed a full refund as it was a sale item. Avoid purchasing anything off this store. I will just be putting it in the bin!
109,"ordered a ""hat"". when it arrived, it was some odd pieces of fabric with a hole in it. i returned it for a refund to the address they gave, at my expense. a month ago, and they still have not refunded my money,. they said they turned it over to their finance dept.what a bunch of crooks."
110,"I have had a very good experience with Zartoni; I‚Äôve bought 4 beanies (2 at a time) over the past few months in time for our Aussie winter and they are great, really well made and very nice to wear, I wear them all the time. Delivery to east coast Australia was quick and easy to track. Yes they are made in China but isn‚Äôt nearly everything these days. I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy any other clothing or footwear from Zartoni and prefer to buy local in these COVID-19 times and I would have some concerns regarding sizing. The beanies were exactly what I wanted."
111,"Total scam! Clothes are much different than advertised. Cheap, falling apart, clearly a bait and switch. Customer service is non existent. Paid to ship back return and have not heard any response from them. AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
112,"I got my pullover as ordered. It took quite a long time, several weeks. On the other hand I am very satisfied to the quality and colours. Nothing to complain about. This was my second order and both had long delivery times, but it is not so important to me. Quality matters."
113,"Likewise, I have not received my order more than a month now. Tracking the item is a joke as it is bouncing from one facility to another to no end. This tracking number is made-up and programmed to look like it is a real tracking number. I think this Chinese company is a FRAUD!!!"
114,"I place an order two months ago (streched pants) after some time i decided to check reviews about the company and i saw it wasn‚Äôt good. I didn‚Äôt like that it came from china, as it said it was from italy. Today i received my order. I‚Äôm completely satisfied with it!"
115,"ZERO STARSOrdered goods marketed as Italian, which is fraud as they are obviously manufactured in China. Shipping would take around three to four days, Three weeks later and still not received the goods. Again, fraud. Someone ought to sue the s**t out of Zartoni."
116,"This company is the worst. I wish I would have read the reviews about delivery. Do not order from this company. You place and order, they charge your card and you have to wait 7 business days to find out an order number. Now they say I have to wait 7-14 days for delivery."
117,"So after my review yesterday, Zartoni responded ‚Äúsomeone will get in contact with you‚Äù as you can see below. Well guess what, nobody reached out to me or processed my refund... this is all part of the Zartoni scam!"
118,"I bought a shirt that I saw advertised on social media. I received it about 3 weeks later. Their website claims ""prime Italian fashion"", however the product was shipped from China and was of very poor quality. It was also not the brand advertised (the brand I received is called Reverb). When I contacted them to return it, I was told that shipping was at my own cost and they are located in Slovakia, so it would probably cost me the price of the shirt just to return it. In the end, they offered me a 20% refund and to keep the shirt - which is of no use to me, as it is way too big."
119,I like the hat. The color is a lot lighter than the picture indicated.
120,"I ordered over 2 months ago, my package has been sitting in Rochester for weeks now, no costumer service or way to get help, it‚Äôs actually amazing a business like this is allowed to exist."
121,"My package arrived a few days later, and I had missing items I was very upset, but the customer service agent was unbelievably helpful and efficient. Really pleasant experience, thank you!"
122,"According to the website this company is selling Italian clothes, but seems to ship from China. All products can be found on AliExpress. This makes shipping time way longer than shown on the website. Would not advise to buy here."
123,"I never usually post comments like this, but this is a scam company. They market their products on social media (Instagram) in my case as high end Italian fashion. They suggest their discounted products are at half the expected retailing value. After puchasing an item, it takes 3 weeks to arrive (from China) and the brand name is completely different (""Reverb""). The product quality is very poor and I received a completely different colour and size to what I had purchased. To return, it costs ~$20 which is the initial ticket price itself.The slick online marketing may tempt you, but save your money and don't fuel this money making racket. Good luck!"
124,"Products do not look like the advertising photos on the homepage!The clothes ordered (Donovan Corduroy Shirt √ó 1Gray / L) do not look remotely like the advertising photos on the homepage. In addition, there is no form under FAQ or Help Center to return goods if necessary. Nobody has replied to my email either. I think I'll be left with the costs. Thank god it was just a shirt!NEVER AGAIN!!!;)Die bestellten Anziehsachen ( Donovan Corduroy Shirt √ó 1Gray / L ) , sehen nicht im entferntesten aus wie die Werbefotos auf der Homepage. Zus√§tzlich findet man unter FAQ oder Help-Center kein Formular um ggf. Ware zu retournieren. Auch auf meine Email hat bis jetzt niemand geantwortet. Ich glaube ich bleibe auf den Kosten sitzen. Gott sei Dank war es nur ein Hemd!NIE WIEDER!!! ;)"
125,"The product was fine and appears to be solid quality.  However, the delivery took quite a bit longer than anticipated.  We hoped to have had the items by Christmas, but they were actually delivered several weeks later."
126,Garbage quality coat. It looks like a nice coat on the website but when it arrived it was made of cheap felt. The kind of material a dollar store Christmas stocking would be made of. It's hideous and I'm throwing it out.
127,"It‚Äôs been over a week, sad to see these reviews, crazy that instagram is filled with these bogus sites. Second time this year fell for a bogus site. Only ordering through amazon from now on. Hate this nonsense."
128,Very slow - was getting worried as have still not received my order done 23rd November and no updates dice the initial confirmation. There is a China post tracking number. Even more worried now I‚Äôve found these other comments. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you order anything. I‚Äôll posts and update if I get anything.UPDATED POST - I received my order last Friday - the beanie hats I ordered were good quality and I am pleased with them.  Given that the order had come from China I am amending my post to satisfactory.  I would use again if I wasn‚Äôt in any particular hurry.  I think it would be helpful if Zartoni gave expectation if order dates to customers to prevent them from making unnecessary queries or worrying.
129,"The shorts didn't quite fit my size but I like the quality, arrived a little bit later than expected. I thought the material would be more stretchy than that but It's fine"
130,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THE PRODUCT IS SUB-PAR AND RUNS WAY TO SMALL THEY REFUSE TO RETURN MY EMAILS PER THEIR POLICY. DO NOT PURCHASE ITS GARBAGE LOOKS LIKE ITS MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE
131,"Slow!!!!I ordered a hat on December 14, 2019. Still no hat and was told I can only cancel an order within 1 hour of purchase. This company maybe a scam . Buyers please beware!"
132,Thought it would be italian clothes with good quality. Clothes was shipped from china. Probably could have bought it from aliexpress or wish for a third of the price..
133,Nothing like what the product looks like. Returns are impossible to make. The shipping took forever. Will never buy from this place again.
134,The worst online service about. Do not purchase from this business. Item never arrives and customer service is simply useless. Do not purchase from this business.
135,"Ordered Hat & Sweater Nov 25. Tracking information from order status update states my ""item has been processed through a facility in GUANGZHOU EMS, CHINA at 3:35 am on December 3, 2019."" Yesterday [12/16]I wrote to get an update. Today [12/17] Zartoni sent me an email with a link. Quick response! YAY! Guess what the link says? My ""item has been processed through a facility in GUANGZHOU EMS, CHINA at 3:35 am on December 3, 2019."" BOOO! Email also informs me the order could take up to 8 weeks. Double BOOO! Also says that if my order had multiple items they will likely arrive separately. Triple BOOO!Based on other reviews I'm not overly optimistic about this.I guess you get what you pay for. So buyers beware, Free Worldwide Shipping probably means it's going to sit on a boat for a month and then on a dock for another month going through customs. Never again."
136,"These guys have the slowest shipping in the Universe. The proverbial ""Slow Boat from China"".  If you want your purchase in under two months, don't buy from them!"
137,"Second time I‚Äôve bought through them. Shipping quite fast. Quality of my beanies are really good. Pricey, but quality. Cheers"
138,"The cheapest China products, worst quality, problems with returning gods, problems with comunication, delivery time more than month.... dont buy enything!"
139,I bought two shirts from them and they eventually came in completely different colours and textures and looked nothing like the images that I bought them off
140,"Ordered October 2019. We're March 2020 and still recieved nothing. No refund, no answers, nothing. Do not purchase from this site!!! It's a scam!"
141,"Useless F*****ng useless Clothes are cheap chinese crap not as advertised, I seen far better clothes in Primark!DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!"
142,Still haven't received my clothes... Ordered weeks ago. No service to provide you with order/delivery details. Do not shop here
143,The shorts I ordered arrived in good time and were exactly as pictured. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
144,Hi zartoni. Really liked the vito beanie I ordered. Didn't took to long to arrive. About 3 weeks. Excellent quality
145,"Ordered a pair of shoes from Zartoni on April 10th 2020, I wish I had read this reviews !Today was time to dispute this !"
146,A total scam. Got a shirt made of poor quality material at an exorbitant price. They do not respond to emails or phone calls.
147,"I, like many of the other reviewers, have never received my product. It appears this company is a HOAX! Don‚Äôt trust them."
148,The quality in the service and products are amazing. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed
149,"good quality, shipment fast. the quality was great as expected from the online specification.I am happy by my purchasing"
150,"The good been delivered in about two months, but quality is high.I would recommend purchase something for yourself.."
151,"Its shocking,  on  pictures and reality too different. Straight away to the bin. Its not even a proper shoe"
152,"Horrific!Still waiting, ordered in March. Awful automated replies and not one sign of a human reply.AVOID!!!!"
153,"‚ÄãExcellent product, shipping met expectations, my kids were pleased with their t-shirts !!!!"
154,Never received the hat I bought it's been nearly 4 months now and customer service doesn't reply to my emails
155,"I highly recommend TenThousand. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the jogger pants, very comfortable and wear extremely well, as do the shirts. I will continue to be a customer and I look forward to my next purchase. Great active wear!!!!!"
156,"Love this brand! I now own 4 pairs of the Foundation short, 3 pairs of the session short and 8 pairs of the Interval short, just adding the new color 'Vapor' to my line up. Highly recommend this brand and advocate for them to anyone who'll listen :)"
157,Matt was amazing!Ten thousand is an amazing product would highly recommend it to anyone that works out extremely durable and stylish.Evan
158,"Have bought multiple pairs of shorts, shirts, and socks and have loved them all. Great customer service and great products!"
159,Great company and great products!  Quality clothing and support staff was super helpful with sizing and ordering.
160,Great customer service. Love the shorts. The most comfortable I own.
161,"They didnt send my order and said that the system had ""a glitch"". oh, but first they said that the merchandise had a hold at port which didnt make any sense since the system wont allow to purshase anything that is not available!!! Finally they offered a store credit like anybody in their straight mind would want to go through this whole process again. Not the experience you would like to have to buy 100 bucks shorts. Customer service to sort the problem was decent."
162,"I bought multiple pairs in different orders and previously enjoyed the shorts. I recently had a pair's adhesive come undone while being cleaned, and I reached out about their Lifetime Guarantee which they refused to honor. No problems with other pairs, but TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE is unhelpful. If I could add photos of the glue coming off of the seam on Trustpilot I would. I don‚Äôt think the quality is very good for what they charge and how awful their customer service is. Wow! It was unbelievable how unhelpful and argumentative their customer service was. Stay away."
163,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. It has been a month and I still have not received my order. Customer service rep told me order was shipped when I looked on the link that they had sent over the item shipping label had just been printed. So, a month to create a shipping label. TERRIBLE."
164,"Bought 6 items 2 months ago. Only received 2 and haven‚Äôt received any updates on the other 4 items. Not worth the price for the clothes either. Very disappointedUpdate: 2.5 months later after contacting my credit card company about a fraudulent charge and then investigating it, they‚Äôve decided to send me a tracking number so I guess the rest is coming now. Still would never order from them again."
165,"Bought the versatile and the lightweight shirt. I really don't like either of them. The sleeves are loose but I couldn't go smaller as the shirt just fits the length to my waist. The material is like pinnie you would put on in gym class, and any claim at order protection is bunk. Sucked in by instagram adversting again..last time I buy anything through those ads without trying on first.I'm 6'2"" 205lbs and bought a large."
166,"SCAM. Don't buy from this company. They had charged to my credit card but never sent me item more than 14 days without any updates. I sent an email to support, but they blamed me because they thought I had no patience. I really don't understand. Support team (Sarah and Angela) was not willing to help, but just yelled to me."
167,Very poor when it comes to customer service. I was at first a fan of the company but it looks like that feeling is now gone. If you guys just want a short then go for it but I would not recommend their service. Their customer service is not existent at this point.
168,"Ordered from them twice now, first time was during a big collab drop so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I ordered a couple tees that took 3 months to show up and this second time it had been over a month when I asked what was going on and they issued me a refund and told me they sold me a product they didn‚Äôt have. Won‚Äôt be going to them again. Overpriced for what they‚Äôre selling you anyways."
169,"I ordered a pair of shorts 18 days ago  and  had to reach out to figure out what happened since they have not sent an update yet. They said they had issues with manufacturer and my order should ship out any day..  Same thing happened again a year ago when I purchased my prior shorts. Their shipping, customer engagement is horrible. Nobody needs to chase for the service/item they paid on the day of the transaction."
170,I just recently discovered your products and have placed several orders over the last couple of months. Everything I've received is EXCELLENT! Super happy about everything I've gotten. The only thing that's a bit frustration is a lot of the products I want are out of stock. However I do understand these are unusual times and I'm sure your doing your best. Thank you.
171,"Got the distance shorts and the weld taping around the pocket started coming off after the first wash and now there is a hole where the pocket is connected to the shorts because of it. I contacted customer service about the ""lifetime guarantee"" and was pretty much told it was my fault and they don't cover me damaging the shorts. I didn't snag it, I didn't pull it, I wash on cold and air dry, this is a manufactur defect. The guarantee is a gimmick. For almost $70 this is unacceptable. Plus the customer service is trash, either computer operated, or copy and paste responses."
172,"This would have been my fourth purchase with TenThousand and will absolutely be my last.  A company that spends more on omni-channeling marketing than it does on its infrastructure to deliver a product.  Would have loved a product (that was in stock) within 4 weeks, but was too tall of an ask and no follow-up.  Purchase Legends or vuori shorts instead"
173,"Everything about my experience was great! The guidance online was spot-on for my fit and sizing, delivery was free and quick, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my products. The level of quality from Ten Thousand is amazing, and the overall experience was so good that I‚Äôve been telling friends about it. Super impressed and will be back for more!"
174,"Wish I had investigated further before ordering. What people say is true -- customer service is abysmal. They simply do not have any of their s*** together. They have ridiculous processing/shipping timelines, and don't give a damn about their customers. to make matters worse, they sent me an automated email asking ""how I like my shorts,"" before i received them! This is 2 days after I sent a customer service inquiry that was never replied to. insane."
175,"This wasn't the worst polo I've purchased, but VERY far from ""Perfect"". I wear an XL & they say it runs a little small so I got an XXL. It is still snug, but it's just odd fitting. It's too short to tuck in (I'm 6ft even) and the sleeves were way too short as well. It shows off the guns, but is uncomfortable for golf. It also just feels like a thicker cotton fabric like from the 80's. With all the dry-fit, moisture wicking, soft, silk-like fabrics available I expected this to feel really nice, but it's just average & not remarkable. Won't buy another & this will sit in my closet the longest."
176,"Great fit and feel, I have bought a range of colours and would highly recommend the cranberry! The navy blue is very similar to the black but is a great shirt none the less.Had issues with the order through customs but the baobab customer love team were helpful and kind."
177,For the life of me these are two smart guys but they're so stubborn and resistant and renaming this item my God you got to be able to let the customer say your name people don't know how to pronounce it and they got the perfect shirt. And the perfect name is the Perfect Polo
178,Never buy from this company they are running a scam they took my money and canceled my order almost immediately this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me I don't know how they are still in business don't waste your money they won't give it back or send you any product
179,"Has the potential of being a really good shirt, however, its sizing is far off from conventional shirts.  I ordered their XXL expecting it will fit loosely and with room to shrink; I was shocked at how tight the shirt fit by the time it arrived.  Some of us don't like tight fitting clothing.  I'm trying to make contact with BAOBAB to process a return and they are no where to be found--they are not answering emails or otherwise."
180,"Terrible service. I ordered a med. shirt in sept, took forever to get here, returned it in nov for a large and still don't have it back as of dec 6th.They said it was delivered.  no phone Number to call them , emails are not promptly returned. They need to get their act together, terrible customer service."
181,"I have just ordered my third shirt from from Baobab. Obviously, I like the product. The fit is perfect and it is now my go to polo for business casual and business travel. It really does wear well and has the extra benefits of being perspiration resistant and easily washable."
182,"The Baobab Polo shirt has exceeded my expectations from the first time I put it on. I literally feel invincible when I wear it! Not only does it compliment my build, but it can be worn in multiple settings. I look forward to ordering more colors to include in my wardrobe in the near future."
183,The pants are amazing! So comfortable. I literally wear them every day!
184,Ordered a pair of shorts three weeks ago. Still says waiting in item at post office. Have contacted multiple times and continue to be pushed off. They have no phone number to call. Terrible customer service. At this point they basically stole $70 from me.
185,"Mostly based on poor fit. I am a true M in joggers/sweatpants. I ordered the Wayne Regretski's (khaki) joggers since that color is pretty unique. Delivery took quite a while (maybe 2 weeks?) and they felt like a size S. Very tight just about everywhere, and if they were to shrink at all they would be unwearable. So, as much as I like their marketing, their products just aren't as good."
186,"Possibly my least favorite company I have ever had to interact with. Bad product, insufferable advertising, no respect for their customers."
187,"I own several pairs of BD pants and shorts, and the reason is simple.  Because they're so comfortable! Confusing pockets?!?! LOL get out of here.  They keep you wallet off to the side and the inside liner is amazing.  Got a pair and didn't like color, no problem they immediately shipped a different pair out for me. I'll continue to keep picking new pairs as they come out.  WORTH IT!!!"
188,"Ordered a pair of 7"" shorts from them. Pretty disappointed overall with the construction. They fit more like 5"" shorts and don't have enough leeway around the seat. Movements like deep squats can result in some pinching. The cords along the inner waistband may as well be non-existent because they're so short. The pocket room is also very awkward to use. Expected much more for a pair of shorts at that price."
189,"We were supposed to work together on a marketing campaign, for which my company was hired, and they disappeared and stopped responding to emails after the work had been delivered. Highly unprofessional and incredibly disrespectful of our time. Unfortunately the bill was not enough to take legal action. This company does not show an ounce of integrity in their dealings."
190,"Ordered my first pair and loved them. Ordered another pair and, more than a month later, still waiting for them to be shipped. Tracking says the shipment is pending. Contacted the manufacturer and got nowhere. They blamed it on the coronavirus. Really, give me a break.  Customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
191,"Unfortunately this is a scam site, they offer things at below market rates for a reason. After I bought I was charged and received and email of confirmation but weeks passed without shipping or hearing anything. I tried calling many times and sending various emails. I got one response after a week with the original confirmation email. I would really advise against using this site."
192,"Slow service and never respond to messages or voice-mail. It's been almost a month and haven't received my order. This is what they promise on their website ""$20.00 via Expedited Priority Shipping ( 2- 5 Business Days) *All orders take 2 Business Days to Process"". Never going to order again. They lie that the order has been refunded. Never received the refund. They just take your orders as they dont have inventory and then place your orders in turkey for inventory. DONOT buy from this place. Spend extra money and buy original."
193,"This is a total scam site.  The email address that is used to send the order confirmation is latinmaids.com and nobody will respond to any of my emails.  Please beware!!!After sending two emails to the merchant one for additional information and one to cancel the order completely, Gwen's still did not respond so I had had my bank step in to assist.  Weeks after this, Gwen's ""shipped"" out my order but who knows what is in the box, if anything.  If the item arrives as described, I will remove my review and cancel the dispute with my bank.  However, if the item does not arrive or if a different item is in the box, the review and dispute will remain.  Not sure why you wouldn't respond to two emails but you will respond via Trustpilot?  That seems suspicious as well."
194,i never even received my order. It‚Äôs been over a month.
195,My go-to for the latest trends while saving my pockets!
196,Warning!!! Do not buy from this company!!! They send over a random coat from Pakistan and hope you won't bother to get your money back. They don't even try to replace your coat with the one they advertise with probably because it's non-existing.Don't do business with these people because it will cost you money for a coat that you did'nt want.
197,"My experience with this website was just okay. I was satisfied with the product that was delivered to me although some of the information present in the product description could not be seen on the jacket. The shipment came in just in time however, the customer service was slow."
198,I have received my jacket and I am extremely happy with it. I would like to take the time to thank everyone involved and I truly appreciate the effort.I will be returning to do business with you in the next few months. Thank you so much for your excellent service.
199,"I enjoyed using this website as it was pretty easy to use and to handle! The jackets were amazing and the prices made me scream in joy. There was a variety of jackets, ranging from guardian of the galaxy jackets to the batman jackets. This website made my day!"
200,"I purchased a men's Captain america jacket, they sent me a women's jacket (zipper on left).  I contacted them to replace it.  They said that rather than replacing it with the costs (to me) to ship and them to reship a new item.  It would be just as well to take a RCSO returning customer special offer 40% off next order.  So, eventually I find a female Cap fan and sell the jacket.  Now I wish to redeem my 40% off and they say that it expires 3 months after being issued.  Nowhere on the site or in the correspondence was that ever mentioned.  Just to solidify what kind of company this is;  I reviewed the item on their website and the review was REMOVED.  For a company selling a majority of Hero and Superhero type goods they do not appear to have any honor themselves.   So BUYER BEWARE!  As for me, I see my lawyer tomorrow, it is a matter of principle now."
201,Comfortable clothings and good value for money. Thanks.
202,"UPDATE: I was able to get ahold of some one in customer service, Nayeli I was very transparent about the current status of the order as well as the next steps. Also thank you to David F. who answered my original review and was extremely considerate, concise and informative with the status of the order.  They even went above and beyond and left a message apologizing and ensuring it was on its way. Big thanks and a display of excellent customer service. Thank You!  Original review: I ordered  a custom Jersey which I was extremely excited about to gift and its been about a month without a single update. Is it coming?I will never know because it is imposssible to reach anyone. Tried the phone, email and hoping to have some luck here. Order number 423806489."
203,"Ordered a soccer jersey two months ago, and it still has not arrived. Got a tracking number, but nothing since.  Have tried reaching out for assistance but no response. Think I‚Äôve been scammed.  Do not work with this company."
204,I order √† pair if shoes from them and I receive a tracking number who doesn‚Äôt work when I try to see update of where my shoes are so I have no idea if I‚Äôm gonna receive them very unprofessional from them that I cannot see if my item was shipped I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm gonna receive them it‚Äôs Bein 2 weeks since I haven‚Äôt got knew my order number is 423721570
205,Ordered a pair of size 15 us men‚Äôs tiempos and I paid 40 dollar‚Äôs delivery ordered on the 22 nd of July and haven‚Äôt got a single update It was supposed to be delivered late august been waiting a month and halfI‚Äôve also emailed twice and haven‚Äôt got a response Any answers ?
206,I have a question about my order. I placed an order for 3 jerseys on the 29th of July. It has said it's been processing since then and I would just like to know the state of the order. I emailed customer service however I have yet to receive a response. I would like to know if everything is okay.Order Number: 423163318
207,I had to return 2 √≠tems of an order I placed. The process was simple but a bit harsh at the begining. The other √≠tems on my order (all football Shirts) were fines.
208,Absolute garbage material. I ordered 3 Barcelona jerseys and sweaters. And it‚Äôs the cheapest quality material and the Barcelona logo is a sticker. Garbage.
209,"After reading some reviews I was skeptical about ordering from the website. I still went ahead and order a chivas authentic shirt, the shipping was very fast i was supposed to receive it on Dec 22 but actually arrived on Dec 16 which is amazing the item was just as described I definitely recommend this site and will continue to order from here"
210,Buyer BewareDo not use this company they are scammers and operate in a fraudulent manner.  Action has been taken against this company and they will be handled accordingly so they are held accountable and are not able to defraud any more innocent customers.All of their responses are generic and hold no value.  Worst experience in all my online shopping experience.  If you value your money that you work hard for - DO NOT use this company.
211,"I ordered soccer boots in July. Sent them back because I decided to buy locally, I STILL have not received my refund and it has been 5-6 months.. I have called the company on numerous occasions and they change their answers everytime. Some of the employees are nice and its not their fault but in general the customer service is atrocious."
212,"I order a Arsenal Goalkeeper (XL 2019/20) top back in December 2020 as a present, It took weeks to arrive and the quality of the shirt was POOR. I used the website information to return the product as the confirmation email gave very limited information on exchanges and returns. It explained that I should post write the address on the parcel and write the reason for return in the parcel. How do I go around a refund which I still haven't received? Order number #56683"
213,I ordered a customized jersey more than a week ago and they refuse to tell me anything other than it's being customized still even though they told me it should ship out 2 days ago! I called customer service and they won't give me an estimate on when it will ship! Don't order from this place unless you feel like waiting an extra month just to get your product! I have orders from here before and had no problems but it's not worth it anymore! My order number is 421005916.
214,"Paid over $100 for a Tottenham jersey. Beyond the order confirmation email I never heard from them again. I never got the jersey. I emailed customer service, they never got back to me. I called customer service several times, they never pick up, you just get put on hold for hours. It seems like a scam, don't buy anything from them."
215,"I ordered a France 2018 jersey. It is unquestionably counterfeit, with its iron-on patch. Ordered a genuine one off eBay, and laid side-by-side all the differences between real and fake are super obvious. The company doesn‚Äôt answer their phone or respond to email. I‚Äôve reported them to Nike and my credit card company."
216,"Ordered multiple items that were on sale and looked very good for the brand I chose. Unfortunately all Nike and adidas items were cheap quality and worth nothing for the money I paid. To make my experience worse, I shipped items internationally and paid almost 80 Dollars more. Almost cost me $300 for no value at all. I am very disappointed with my experience with your service. Order no. 418095981."
217,I placed an order on November 27th for a Christmas gift. The shipping label shows it was created on 12/3 and has not had an activity since. I've contact support in regards to the status and was told not to worry. Guess it WON'T be here for our sons present on Christmas morning! Wouldn't recommend as their shipping is slow and their customer service is lack luster!!My order number is 418123759
218,I believe Mr. David F must not like me or racist since I‚Äôm the only one he didn‚Äôt bother to reply on my review on this site! Once again I ordered a Chicago Fire jersey and received a Chicago fire jersey that‚Äôs not even on their website!! Called and customer service sounded just lost when I spoke to them. I sent back their jersey and to this date no refund or Jersey has been sent to me!!! Please stay away from this site!!!! BIG SCAM
219,"I ordered a football top on the 17th November, it finally arrived today. I had been worried as it just seemed too long to wait. I also began to read reviews and had wished I hadn‚Äôt ordered from them. However, the quality of the LUFC top is good and I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. The company answered all my emails, think I sent five in all. Goods coming into the country will only get worse with Brexit, so maybe this is the new norm!"
220,"Dodgy inauthentic shirt I ordered and paid for shirt on 13th November after several emails I received shirt on 7th December.  The shirt was a knock off & not an authentic shirt ,the sizing ,material , letters  & no man utd authenticity sticker on the  label. I contacted the company with my concerns & was asked to send it back which I did on recorded delivery on the 8th December. I am still waiting for my refund & have sent several emails."
221,"I ordered a Raul Jimenez Mexico soccer jersey on November 24 and it still hasn‚Äôt came in, and it‚Äôs a Christmas gift for someone. It says it arrived at the usps facility, it‚Äôs been like that since December 11. I‚Äôve ordered stuff recently from other places that‚Äôs going to be on time for Christmas. I‚Äôm just very irritated since I‚Äôve been waiting almost a whole month for the jersey that isn‚Äôt even close to arriving on time for Christmas. Order# 418085260"
222,"Ordered a pair of shoes, then saw the delivery date, it was too long to wait so I canceled within an hour of ordering through email and they said it‚Äôs already left even though the delivery date isn‚Äôt for 6 weeks.  They try to keep your money. Meesha  the customer rep blatantly lied. Avoid at all costs. Not worth it. So disappointed"
223,"My delivery was right on time, excellent quality, prompt customer service, would definitely buy here again, glad i didn't get carried away by the bad reviews!"
224,"Ordered a football shirt 3 weeks ago and still not arrived. I have sent an email and no response and tried to call but can't get through.I have only received an original email confirming purchase, heard nothing else.I am now beginning to doubt this store and they have taken my money.Order number was 27694Just found this at bottom of order confirmationThanks for using worldfootballshop.co.uk!"
225,Ignores me and my girlfriend for days.Placed an order last week of November still haven‚Äôt received it.No email to confirm it‚Äôs despatched or anything and just reply with the same message about it being despatched when it has not.This is meant to be a Christmas present by reading other reviews they‚Äôve messed them up too.Limited responses on live chat if they respond that is and if you call them they just keep you on hold! ¬£70 down the drain and a ruined Christmas
226,I‚Äôve placed an order paying the extra $30 shipping to have it expedited and 14 days later I still do not have my order and have no idea where it is.  The address on the site is Oregon but this company is out of China. items are shipped from China.  If I had known that I would never have ordered knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get them in time.  I can probably kiss that $200 good bye.  Never order from this company!!
227,"Sent back a Liverpool shirt, due to this being a gift but I had the wrong size. They are claiming ignorance and refusing to give me a refund. So ¬£60 odd pound down the drain. I‚Äôve been told they do this from someone who had a similar issue just didn‚Äôt believe it to be true. If you buy from this company ensure you have the right size first. After making a couple of complaints I‚Äôve now finally got through to someone who was willing to help and I‚Äôve now been given my refund"
228,Order number : 417337600 when I first placed the order you guys took $261.10 from my account to hold to place on my card to verify that sufficients funds are available to cover the order total. But it says that it was supposed to be dropped off within a few business days rendering the balance available again. But it was never dropped back off into my account so i am still missing $261.10 from my account. Recently you took $261.10 dollars again when I already payed in the beginning.
229,"Placed order on August 16  (No. 420322787). After initial acknowledgement that items were in stock, the order was not placed. They don't respond to emails and you can't get through on toll free number. Very disappointed as I have ordered with them in the past with no issue"
230,"I ordered two rangers football tops on 14th Nov, I have sent 4 emails and still had no reply, I have been on live chat and was told they would be dispatched today 4th Dec and confirmation email and tracking no sent and surprise surprise no email!! Would certainly not recommend!! Customer service is appalling!"
231,"The reason i give this company is that the stars are actually for the reviewers as i was literally about to pay 170plus dollars on an Arsenal jersey and after hearing sooooo many reviews of counterfit, no customer service, no refunds, RETAIL CATFISHERS. So relieved i didnt buy."
232,"I ordered a pair of Puma Evodisc goalkeeper gloves.  I never got an order number, an email or anything.  I got my credit card statement and the charge was on there.   It said 2 days shipping and it‚Äôs been 14 and I still haven‚Äôt seen my gloves.  I called and was told my email and phone number weren‚Äôt in their system.  mothergoose0925@yahoo"
233,Absolutely horrible. I was forced to purchase with PayPal. So two weeks later I finally get a tracking number and it said it had already been delivered to my house about a week earlier so I called the post office for them to tell me that they sent it to a completely different address. Scammers scammers scammers
234,I ordered a top on 26/11/2020 for a Christmas present. It still has not come. When I emailed they had said oh it has been dispatched will be there by Friday which was two weeks ago!! Today is Christmas Eve so I definitely will not be receiving this top. I‚Äôm so disheartened and feel scammed!#55230
235,So I bought a 20/21 Bayern Munich CL jersey with the name and number set for Robert Lewandowski. The jersey was great 100% authentic but the name set and number weren‚Äôt the original front it was like some random printing that you would see on a Sunday league team jersey. I was kinda disappointed because I really liked the shirt now I don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not correct. And now I can‚Äôt do anything about it because they have a policy that a custom shirt can‚Äôt be returned. Order number 417779833 if you can help in anyway.
236,"I Ordered a Chelsea jersey for my grandson for his birthday.  The World Soccer Shop price was over $100, but when I received the jersey the MSRP price tag was $75!!!  I tried contacting Customer Service via email about this price difference, and have received no response after 2 or 3 weeks."
237,I ordered a jersey that was too small and returned it for a bigger size. Meaning I had to rebuy it. I send the small one back and got the large one and I never got my Refund for the small one. I send 3 emails and it‚Äôs been 2 months. I spend over $400 and I have 1 Jersey not 2. Don‚Äôt bother with this place.
238,Stocked items and shipping time is not accurate.
239,Hello I ordered 2 jerseys back on the 27 November 2019 which I needed to give to my children for Christmas. My credit card has been made and paypal made a successful transaction. I have no tracking details from AUSPOST and its the 17th of December 2019 and I have no shipment details of when its going to arrive
240,"Made an order on 13/8, got order confirmation stating dispatch on 17/8 and arrival 23/8. Never heard from them sknce. Customer service hasn't responded to my emails in 3 days and phone line keeps you on hold for hours.Order 420289259This is my last order."
241,"Been using WSS for a long time. Always had a good experience.Prices were competitive, item shipped fast, and item safely arrived on time. I've used World Soccer Shop many times and have never been disappointed. And Always a great experience for shopping in this web. Fast shipping and awesome service !!!!!!"
242,I have been a customer of WSS for about 8 years now. I buy jerseys here and there when I find some that really appeal and this site offers the widest variety I have found anywhere. They are consistently great with communication and delivery and recent communication is what prompted this review. They communicated as soon as they knew that one of my items would be backordered and provided me with options. I also feel they are very transparent and will certainly go to them for all of my soccer jersey needs
243,Bought a couple of pairs of boots during the current sale and used the free global shipping code. Purchase went through without a hitch. A week later I hadn't heard anything and no movement on my order info so I e-mail them. They replied that the free global shipping can't be applied to my order (no idea why) and they will have to charge me $70 for it. Thats 50% of the order value so I cancelled and bought local. Please don't offer something that you cannot supply and waste my time.. Edit for reply - order No. 415105841
244,Ordered a shirt over a month ago and heard nothing until I chased them up regarding my order. Customer service response wasn't useful and when I tried to cancel my order they seemed to get their arses in gear and process my order so I could not cancel. Bunch of tight money grabbing b*******
245,"I ordered a custom jersey in mid-July and have received multiple shipping delay notices without any explanation. The jersey is currently scheduled for delivery almost two months after the order date. Given that I already paid (a ridiculously high sum) for this shirt, it is totally unacceptable that this company is not doing everything in its power to deliver it in a timely manner. Terrible experience!!Yes, thank you, David! There is no way to reply to your comment here, so I am editing my original post. Order #413894805"
246,"Seems like there has been a breakdown somewhere. Evidently few of us got our Christmas orders. When I ordered, both items showed ‚Äúin stock.‚Äù  Site said order by dec 18 for Christmas delivery to Maryland. Nothing had even shipped by the 23rd. Thank God for Amazon where I found something I could use. Sent two emails with no response. Finally got a response when I canceled with no explanation. NEVER will order from here. I think they are in someone‚Äôs basement operating an outlet. Obviously no customer service and no accountability."
247,"I ordered a borussia dortmund away shirt on June 9th, my order number is #23698. I understand that with the virus shipping will be delayed but i haven‚Äôt received any information regarding the order. I would just like some reassurance on this and maybe a way to track my order, please."
248,"Order 59447. Still waiting for my order since beginning of Dec, grandchild‚Äôs football kit for Christmas. Can‚Äôt get through on the phone and no one is answering on the on-line chat. I‚Äôve now checked reviews and people are being warned the kits are fake if they do turn up."
249,"Ordered some Liverpool 2020/21 away kits, all tracked and traced. Received them in a good amount of time (USA to NZ) an everything is 100% official (not fakes) & no complaints. There was a 1 week delay from the time I ordered them, to when I was officially charged and item sent out. Not sure on the reason for delay, but I suspect it‚Äôs a supply chain issue, so happy they only charged me once they knew the goods were on the way!Will definitely use the store again if I need to buy something again.I have written this review, because often people only post when the have something negative to say, but I was totally happy!"
250,"Worst online shopping experience i have ever had. Ordered a Jersey. Waited a week to have the money returned back to me with no explanation or follow up email. Just completely awful and rude costumer service, buy your jersey ANY where else."
251,I ordered a football kit for my grandson birthday Back in the beginning of June and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve still not received it his birthday next week and no kit can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taking so long I‚Äôve messaged loads of times and they keep saying it be with you soon
252,"Website looks great, easy to navigate.Apology for the previous comment - there was a site that was skimming from searches for world soccer (world soccer net) and pretending to be your company.  They have been shut down thankfully...only lost $39.95 US ..best of luck"
253,Just received my FC Porto shirt after waiting for over 3 weeks very disappointed! Stitching poor on shirt and of inferior quality ! Clearly a fake and after spending ¬£60 inc post and Packing I expected better. I certainly won‚Äôt be using this site again !
254,"Have shopped several times with them and am happy with their quality of products. Only issue I really have is that their shipping is generally pretty delayed or on backorder. Other than that, a good spot."
255,I have bought different items where shipping was supposed ti be free based on special offer FREE75 but I was surprised that I was charged for shipping? Order number 418095981. I hope you can help me to refund shipping charges. Many thanks. Jaber
256,To Canada in under 7 days even with FedEx carrying most of that wait time. Beautiful Jersey. Authentic as promised. It fits perfectly and I am pleased with the purchase. Will order again.
257,"i really like the website itself, very helpful and easy to search and buy the product I want. They have discounts whenever I go to the website. I bought a couple of jerseys and football boots. They took 3 weeks to get to my place, but it was worth the wait."
258,"I am sorry to hear that others have had issues in receiving their orders from WorldSoccerShop, but in my case, I had no issues. I ordered a Boca Juniors jersey on 21 April, and I received it on time before 24 April.  I was impressed at how efficient the delivery service was after having paid extra to have it delivered by FedEx.Regarding the quality of the Boca jersey - it's excellent! Kudos to WorldSoccerShop for selling jerseys from a wide range of clubs, including South American clubs. As well, I appreciated receiving an e-mail from WorldSoccershop with the tracking number. I definitely look forward to shopping in the future with WorldSoccerShop!"
259,Dont ever trade with this company. I made an order in June and the parcel never arrived. Several times I asked to tracking number but the company never answered. Finally after several attemps they informed the parcel was lost. I asked for a new delivery. But it did not arrive either. Not even my account in the website was updated and never got the tracking number. Since then I have asked for refunding but they do not answer my messages. I have tried to call customer service but they dont answer my calls. This is a cheating company and should be shut down. Ripped for oppotunities to trade and make business.
260,I ordered a Jersey to arrive in time for an important game and was surprised it was sent to an address I haven't lived at for months. I move a lot for work. Apparently the website took information from my Billing address and used it as my shipping address. I know I sent it to my current address because glitches on the website forced me to order it twice to my apartment number. The Same glitch sent it to the wrong address. I wanted to order another jersey for my girl but I will not be doing that and will order from another company. I will also return the Jersey once I make my 300 mile drive to my old address.
261,I ordered some soccer cleats and i got the tracking number but i dont know who the carrier is. I'll give a 5 star if y'all tell me who the carrier is. They told me my carrier thanks
262,"More of a question, The new barcelona jersey is available in 3xl will it be us/uk sizing or will it be like china and to small, before i order ?"
263,"My order 12207006577. Got mail stating sent on 4/8/21. Never arrived. Mailed them. Received reply stating they were checcking with courier. Got no update. Mailed again, no reply. Going to try and get my money back."
264,"!The worst experience ever, order a pair of shoes and the size was incorrect,they send me a pair of kids shoes instead of adults size. Send it back to them for full refund after almost waiting for a week, they partially refunded my money. When I call them they said that they had to charge me for shipping so they had to keep the rest of the money and whatever you got back in the account that was for the cost of the item and they get to keep the rest for shipping and taxes. Update 7/25 !Got my money back!but all this negative review wouldn't had happen if lady in customer service would it help me in first place thanks!"
265,Always has a selection of bigger sizes for a big guy like myself. Very personable and helpful customer service whenever I have called. The turnaround time from time of order to shipment is relatively quick. Thanks again for the great experience.
266,I would like to refund my order. My order number is 422487570. I would like my money back asap. I‚Äôm also Canadian so I paid in CDN. The total was $373.10
267,"I order one expensive cleat for a Christmas gift, since Dec 1, on Dec 23 didn‚Äôt arrive ,I sent 3 emails no answers,did call but just a   answer machine not from a company ,not a track number, not a word, from them. Is this site a scam?"
268,"Order number 420263478 placed 11/8/21. Email says shipped 3 weeks later. After repeated requests, I was sent tracking number. It is invalid, it's not recognized. Asked PayPal to intervene. Asking for refund."
269,I ordered a jersey and it was too small so I returned it and bought a larger one. It‚Äôs been 2 months and I still have not received my refund for the one that was too small. I send 3 emails and nothing. Don‚Äôt buy form them.
270,"Ordered a liverpool away shirt and im pleased with it , took a little longer to come than other shops but they responded to my emails and even refunded the delivery charge, so overall was happy with world football shop"
271,Ordered 6.12.20..didnt come until 30.12.20..Shirt defective from Thailand and clearley a fake.. Have returned item 8.1.21 as asked and still no refund.. Website now says cannot be reached.. Avoid avoid avoid..
272,"Ordered a shirt on January 9th 2021, its now March 16th and the shirt has not arrived. I have tried numerous times to contact them via the information on the website and have heard nothing back.AVOID!!!"
273,my shirts nearing 5 months of not being delivered and i wouldnt put it past them to delay another 2 months waiting neary half a year for an order is ridiculous order number 420395662
274,"I made an order with number #418010815 on 11/16/20 for ""Liverpool 20/21 Away All Weather Jacket by Nike"". Before I made my purchase I send an email to them asking if this is an authentic nike product and the next day they replied me that ""Yes it is an official nike product"". So i made my order.At 12/04/20 the product arrived and I saw the label on the plastic cover that it is a replica product, not a genuine product. I tried to reach them several times with email and messenger but no reply until now. I asked for refund because they lied to me that this would be genuine product.This is not a professional behavior to customer and i will try to get my money back through my bank because i believe that this website is a fraud"
275,"Bought a jersey for my husband in October and am still waiting on jersey . Do not buy from this website, I‚Äôm just livid with this company. Life is stressful enough never mind dealing with this company"
276,My online order went very smoothly and without any hassles. I received my purchase on a timely basis. I would highly recommend shopping for any Soccer related gear From them. They offer a vast supply of options.
277,"I ordered a celtic top for a christmas present,3 weeks after the order and 3 emails asking where my order was with the same response saying the top would be in the uk this week and would be ready for delivery i realised it was coming from foreign lands your guess is as good as mine i phoned and actually got someone who obviously wished they hadnt answered because i was raging,told them what i thought demanded my money back and 4 days later ive got my money back,NEVER AGAIN------- they responded the next day to my review wanting to understand what went wrong  ,my advise to them is read 90% of other reviews and they can see what the problem is,most people say the same thing WHERES MY ORDER dont promise a few days tell them the truth"
278,"The website is very user friendly and easy to find products that you are looking for. The one critique I have is that it isn‚Äôt as visually pleasing as some other online retail websites, but is by no means bad."
279,I ordered predator 20 pro goalkeeper gloves blue and red. I never got the email that confirms the order. So I cant track it either. I ordered them 4 days ago and I don't know if they even shipped.
280,"I purchased some Neymar cleats pro on the 15th with the order number of 417775710 and it was supposed to arrive today but i got an email they canceled it, how do i get the money back?"
281,Taken the money out of the account(¬£53) and still no football shirt over a week later. Customer service phone rings off and email option comes up with an error message!!!! Not impressed.
282,Every time I order off worldsoccershope I know I‚Äôm getting an authentic jersey just wish the my had more smaller teams to order from but they have a good selection of the teams they do have
283,"order soccer cleats from the world soccer shop and also talk to the customer service, they still haven't shipped the order in three weeks. My order number is 420549814"
284,Ordered a football strip 29th December kept being told on live chat it would be dispatched next week we are now 6 weeks on and they now ignoring emails phone etc shocking company
285,"Quality and service used to be good but have gone down recently. Cutting corners on customized apparel as well, offering screen print shoulder badges in place of better-quality felt ones."
286,I ordered a jersey in July and was just told it's back ordered until mid-December.  Waiting 5 months for a delivery is absurd.  Definitely not using them again.
287,I had a good experience. The product provided was accurate to what was advertised. My only suggestion is to give consumers more confidence in their purchase by offering free returns.
288,Be careful what you order from them !! I ordered an authentic jersey and PAID for an authentic jersey but they sent a replica instead and never answered me about my concerns.
289,Ordered one $20 item. Paid $9 shipping since it was the only place that had the size needed. Took twelve days to receive it. I was unaware the pony express still existed.
290,"I ordered my jersey aug 26th and only got a processing email since then, i emailed them 3 days ago and never got a response. The order number is #3705"

296,"We ordered a number of jerseys. They split my order in two and the second part of the order contains only 1 instead of 4 jerseys. We've reached out several times and been waiting for a week for a follow-up email: no response.UPDATE OCTOBER 21: We've sent them another 2-3 emails. We've provided David F with the order number.--> NO REPLY.order 414597045 (we've sent numerous emails)UPDATE 10/22:David F has contacted us, replied promptly and fixed the issues as well as he could - which is good customer care. Rating changed to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/23: David F fixed the issue as far as possible, and on top of that made good for the frustration caused which we really appreciate. So despite the hiccups WorldSoccerShop showed their customers are important to them. Trust restored. All in all this was turned around to a 5 star experience.(Note: WSS did not request the initial review to be adjusted)"
297,"Great selection, great prices, great communication and speedy shipping!  I will keep coming back in the future, you have my business!  Thank you."
298,Great selection of soccer gear and apparel. A go-to for hardcore soccer fans or casual fans looking to grab the rest gear at competitive prices.
299,"Items should not take 11 days from Nc to Florida. Stop using freepost.If you say you are going to follow up with a customer,then follow up."
300,Ordered a childs chelsea football kit and the stitching is awful.   The word football foot is smaller than Ball not happy one bit with this
301,The cleats I ordered we in their ‚Äúback order‚Äù and were expected to ship a MONTH after I ordered them so we returned the cleats. Awful service.
302,"I ordered several items.  One arrived, but the other items were delayed again.  My order emails come from info at 365sport.com.  416389896"
303,Ordered a Chicago Fire Jersey and got a completely different Chicago Fire Jersey than the one advertised on their website which they only have ONE!! Jersey was ordered on 11/15/2020 - Which ended up shipping two days later on the 17th once I received the Jersey it didn‚Äôt match what I ordered got a whole different Jersey same team just different Jersey.. Which makes no sense since the Jersey I received is not even on the website!!! I called customer service to see if I can get help... which was a complete headache since they didn‚Äôt even know why I got a Jersey not advertised on their own website... They said they would mail me a new one and here I am a month later haven‚Äôt received it yet.. Oh but they got their Jersey back already and didn‚Äôt even bother to send any confirmation of the new Jersey being shipped out or any tracking number provided!! I have ordered from them before but with this never again! I will just stick with ordering straight from manufacturers like Adidas Or Nike!!!!
304,I had a order of the as Roma 3rd kit 19/20 with D≈æeko on the back and a serie a patch but i didnt get the serie a patch on it.Order #2007
305,My son ordered a pair of Liverpool FC New Balance home shorts #22285.This was on 31st May and it‚Äôs now 16th June and have heard nothing.

309,Very nice website. Prices are a bit higher than other sites but all in all Worldsoccershop is my first place to look for soccer gear.
310,"Still waiting for my order after 2 weeks, no email updates and customer service number goes to automated message and then cuts off"
311,great experience. Perhaps they need to inform more about sizes. Sometimes size charts from different brands has different dimensions
312,"Ordered cleats for my daughter on 8/18, estimated delivery date was 8/25. On 8/25 the estimated delivery date changed to no delivery date available at this time.  A few days later a new delivery date of 9/5 showed up, on 9/5 the delivery date again was changed to no delivery date available at this time.  I checked customer service on the website and found out the company knew the shipping was running 2 weeks behind but still advertised a date knowing they would not be able to meet that posted date.  I called customer service only to be told once it is shipped it is out of their hands and she is sorry but I should have it by the end of the week.  My daughter plays collegiate soccer and developed a hole in her current cleats and she is not local to me, I was expecting her to have her cleats two weeks ago and still no cleats and no idea a to when they will arrive.  I paid $11 for shipping for what?  and again all I was offered is sorry and they should be there by the end of the week.  I also emailed customer service 2 days ago and still haven't received a response.  Order #420348585"
313,"Their Twitter Account @WrldSoccerShop are scamming people for likes and followers. They do this by encouraging ppl to guess the score before kick off, tag a friend & winner will win a jersey kit. I literally was the only person to guess the score correctly (3-0 AC Milan) & they never DM‚Äôd me for my prize despite saying they would. False advertising & scam artists! Will NEVER buy from them.

322,"We wore KEP for our wedding and unfortunately the experience we had was overall stressful and disappointing. We would not recommend KEP to anyone that has a strict deadline and/or anyone who expects a high level of customer service. After receiving a few recommendations from friends, my now husband and I made an appointment in the NYC store on May 10 looking for white jackets and black pants (for made to measure) for our wedding on the west coast on August 20 (so, at least 3 months in advance). After a LOT of back and forth (finding white vs. cream fabric is a lot more difficult than it sounds) we finally found fabric that we wanted and on May 24 went through the entire process of getting measured and paying a lot of money (thousands of dollars each) for the outfits. Since KEP was a well-known brand, especially in the gay community, we were excited about our decision to splurge a little bit on this, with the expectation that the service would be great and that this would be something we didn‚Äôt need to stress out about last-minute. We were very wrong. Fast forward a month later, on June 21, we received a call from KEP saying that they actually didn‚Äôt have enough of the white fabric we chose to make two jackets, and there wasn‚Äôt enough time to wait until they received more in stock. So they said we should come back in to pick a different fabric. Since we already paid and already got measured and frankly didn‚Äôt have enough time to go elsewhere, we rushed into the store to pick a different fabric. The new fabric we chose cost more than our original, and given the situation KEP offered it to us at no additional charge. We felt like things were back on track and looked forward to our fitting a few weeks before the wedding to make any last-minute adjustments. More time goes by, and then we hear from KEP saying that they need to push our fitting from a few weeks before the wedding to 10 days before the wedding. We became more nervous, especially because we had planned for KEP to ship the outfits to the west coast so we wouldn‚Äôt have to travel with them. Then, when that date approached, KEP said we would have to push it to 8 days before the wedding (the Friday before). We became more nervous. When we came to the fitting, we learned that only the jackets were ready, and not the pants. The jackets needed adjustments. We asked when the pants would be ready for us to try on and they said they would let us know ASAP. The entire weekend went by and we did not hear anything from them. We called, messaged, and texted just about everyone we could find who works at the company and heard nothing until Monday morning (5 days before the wedding), when they said that everything is fine and that they are shipping our pants directly to the west coast. This obviously made us extremely nervous because this meant that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to trying our pants on prior to the wedding. We asked them to ship the pants to the west coast as soon as possible so we could get them tailored there if necessary. Miray (the co-founder of KEP), instead of apologizing for the last-minute scramble and rushing, reminded us how they have been good partners and assured us that the pants would be fine and that we had nothing to worry about. The pants arrived on the west coast 3 days before the wedding and they were, as expected, too big. In the midst of everything else going on, we had to rush a tailoring job (through a tailor we found on our own) and paid $90 to fix the pants. We picked up the pants the morning of the wedding.The thing that bothered us most was not the fact that our outfits arrived behind schedule. It was the extreme lack of service we experienced throughout the entire process. Communicating with the co-founder of the company, as well as the NYC representative, was always terribly painful. There was a lack of responsiveness, a lack of answers, and a lack of urgency. For a high-end store, we found the service to be seriously disappointing. Having to deal with last-minute adjustments before your wedding (among everything else) is one of the most stressful experiences in itself, but the feeling of having to deal with it alone, without the support of the company you just paid thousands of dollars to, is the highest insult. No one from KEP ever apologized for this experience, instead saying that they understand weddings can be stressful.After the wedding, we emailed Miray asking if they could reimburse us for the $90 rush tailoring. She did not respond. I followed up and said that we were planning to write reviews of all of our wedding vendors online. She did not respond."
323,"There have been several occasions where my sales associate seems either mildly annoyed or clearly contemptuous of my asking detail-oriented questions about the $1500 suits I‚Äôm commissioning. Perhaps I‚Äôm too proletariat to appreciate the finer things in life but there does seem to be a snooty trend among the customer facing retail operators. That said, I LOVE my suits and keep coming back because the overall experience is excellent."
324,"Waiton and crew went above and beyond to make sure my suit was delivered before my wedding, and the suit they delivered was absolutely stunning. I will trust them will all my future business and will highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a suit. I truly can‚Äôt speak highly enough of their customer service and the quality of their suits."
325,"This place is at the intersection of top customer service and quality material. Josh and Evangel made me feel very welcome and answered all my questions with style and pose. By the end of the week, I found myself just wanting to stop in to say hi to my new friends. Definitely my go-to spot for all my future Vegas dapper fashion needs. (Also very LGBTQ friendly for any bois wanting a clean fit). Thanks again for making me look so good on stage!"
326,"Ric and Jeff are great! They created an experience at Klein, Epstein and Parker which has me immediately say I am a regular client. We created a suit expressing exactly who I am for my clients. Looking forward to expanding my wardrobe from Klein, Epstein and Parker with Ric and Jeff."
327,"Tyson was AMAZING, as well as all the other amazing gentlemen who so kindly assisted me in my first purchase in Las Vegas!You have earned a customer for life that‚Äôs for sure! Exceptional service, 10 stars!"
328,"The entire team at the Fashion Valley location are always friendly, stylish and very accommodating. They get excited about the clothing which makes me even more excited to see the piece come to fruition."
329,"Incredible and impressive knowledge! Yet perhaps more importantly, being able to advise on all the elements that go towards making a customized suit. Felt very comfortable and confident in my purchase."
330,"Rude and unprofessional staff - customer experience is not their priority. The quality of their work is inconsistent. For the price point, might as well go to a JoS. A. Bank"
331,"Do you have an enemy who doesn't know they are your enemy? Send them to KEP for a wedding suit!My made to measure wedding suit was made made grossly incorrectly across numerous dimensions. They attempted to fix it repeatedly, and failed (while claiming it was fine). I eventually had to bypass their in-store people and go to their tailor directly. He said the suit had to be to be remade, but we had no time (because they dragged their feet). He had to cut the collar and add extra seams to get through my wedding, and it still didn't fit properly. One day of wedding usage damaged the fabric. They then made a replacement. It fit worse than before and I couldn't even put on the pants. To their credit, after this 3mo of hell they gave me my money back. Not to their credit they sent me an email out of the blue asking me to write this review."
332,"I wish I could use them more often.Clothing is superb.  Service equals, or exceeds clothing satisfaction which is clearly a ""five star"" product line"
333,"Gotta see Josh, man knows how‚Äôs to treat a client and gonna make you look good! Appreciate all the help getting my first made to measure suit!"
334,"Incredible service from Evangel, He was paying attention to all my needs and went further of all my expectations. Wow!! Thank you again!!"
335,Great experience and hope to visit again soon. I purchased two polo/golf shirt that get so many compliments! Thank you!T.P.
336,"Shirts are great, but first time they came with the wrong collar.  They were replaced at no charge but it took a long time."
337,"Stanley was an awesome salesman and the rest of the crew were pleasant, polite, helpful, and extremely friendly."
338,Always available... always accommodating. The level of personal attention is exceptional.
339,Shirts ordered in January. It is June and I don't have them. Need I say more?
340,All aspects of the experience were great.  Now just waiting to see my suit!
341,Awesome customer service by Oz.  Can't wait to see how my suit turns out.
342,"I placed an order 2 weeks ago and I haven't received any shoes yet. They don't even provide an order number in the confirmation e-mail so I can use the tracking in their website.I would consider this a normal problem if it wasn't for the fact that they never answer when I contact them. I've tried through e-mail, chat and answering to the confirmation mail. No response at all.Either this is a scam or they have gone out of business. If you want to see it for yourself, just try the chat in their website. No one will ever answer.If the company reads this, just help me and I will remove the review once the problem is solved."
343,Scam still haven't received shoes or herd back over 1 month
344,Ordered a pair of shoes last Monday with 2-4 days express delivery. Still nothing has happened with the order. I have emailed the company 3 times without response and I have also used their customer support messenger without response. There is no phone number that you can call.Order number: 1083
345,"Like many of the other recent reviews, I placed an order a long time ago and have received no shoes, no shipping emails, and no response to my outreach. They do not provide any number to call, you just have to send an email and hope they respond. Their website touts ‚ÄúShipped in 2-4 Buisiness days‚Äù which is clearly a scam to get you through their checkout. I‚Äôm considering a CC chargeback on this one - avoid this website. And Giga if you see this, I am order #1086"
346,"Ordered shoes.Advertises as made in the USACame in a plastic bag from ChinaPlastic, don't fit description, lower quality product than advertisesRequested a refund and still no answer.This is a dropshipping business and I would advise anyone else looking at buying from them to stay away.Btw giga my order number was #1039 and I will be disputing the payment with my credit card company as I have all the details and proof needed to get the money back.Either contact me today or after 15 days I'll get the money back anyway."
347,"Looks like a scam. No Shoes received, no emails back. Nothing at all!Edit: Order 1072. After nearly 2 weeks, I got a message to say their systems were down for messaging but was told my order had been dispatched. Still not received.Edit 2: it's now the end of August. (More than 2 months since I ordered) Never had anything back from them. Claimed my money back through PayPal. Do not trust."
348,"No response to emails and yet to receive the shoes, approaching two weeks since the order was placed. Avoid at all costs."
349,"I‚Äôve been waiting almost 4 weeks , I still haven‚Äôt received my trainers and I‚Äôve had no response from my emails , there is no way to call them , I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a scam but the webpage is very well made so who knows .Very dissatisfied"
350,"Feels like a scam, the order never arrived and they dont provide updates despite sending them emails."
351,"Scam, no answer to emails or live chat. No tracking number. Order number #1082"
352,Where do I start?! These insoles genuinely changed my life. Being a man who is 5'7 without shoes you always feel like you're at a disadvantage with women. When I wear Giga I stand at a proud 5'10 and feel sooo much more confident. My relationships and career have markedly improved since I started wearing Giga...I pray this brand never leaves us because I can't live without them!!
353,Company has gone dead.  No shoes. No email. No phone number.  Nothing.  Scam!!!!Order #1076
354,"I absolutely love the extra height and confidence my new insoles give me. Nobody suspects a thing either, they're so naturally and they fit inside all of my shoes perfectly. I'm from the UK and shipping was quick, only took a couple of days."
355,They are very well made and have lasted a long time. Highly recommend to all men out there looking to increase there height a bit.
356,The confidence boost I get from wearing these is insane. These almost feel illegal to wear hahaha.
357,If women can wear make-up I get to wear this.
358,"I saw a sweater I liked from Quinn on Facebook. As I was ordering it, a pop-up appeared that said I would receive a 20% discount if I provided my email address. It also stated that I would receive a confirmation email. I provided my email address and clicked the appropriate button. The confirmation email never appeared and neither did the 20% discount code. However, the following day I received an automated email message from Quinn that was a reminder that I had left something in my cart and they would give me 15% off if I completed the transaction. The next day I received another automated reminder that said they would give me  a 10% discount if I completed the transaction. I was annoyed because the pop-up promised a 20% discount. I tried to get a hold of one of their representatives using their website‚Äôs chat feature, but the chat feature was not manned. It said if I didn‚Äôt want to wait (forever apparently), I could provide my email address and someone would get back to me. I did this twice and also sent a regular email to Quinn, but it‚Äôs been five days and no one has responded. I wanted to call them, but their website does not provide a phone number. I‚Äôm shocked to see that there are so many good reviews about Quinn. I couldn‚Äôt possibly take the chance of ordering anything from them when they appear to be a very sketchy, fly-by-night company. I‚Äôm providing this review as an alert to people that Quinn doesn‚Äôt seem to be a reputable company. I would be very wary of purchasing anything from them. If you don‚Äôt receive the merchandise, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to contact anyone. And if you did receive it and needed to return it, could you trust that you‚Äôd get a refund?"
359,"The sweater I ordered is nice but getting it here was a challenge. I paid $15 extra for it to arrive in 2 days. It did not. I requested a reason and was given a dubious answer, and told that if it didn‚Äôt arrive my $15 would be refunded. It was refunded, but I would rather have had the sweater here on time and certainly would rather have had a ‚Äúwe messed up‚Äù than an excuse. I will order from Quinn again to see if the transaction will go smoothly.D. B."
360,This was my first experience with Quinn. On line ordering was seamless. Delivery was on time and the packaging was elegant.The cashmere quality is fabulous. I highly recommend this product and this company!
361,Well I received a tank top thinking it was ‚ÄúQuinn‚Äù brand but alas it was some other random brand......and the quality wasn‚Äôt as good the Quinn pieces I‚Äôve purchased in past. :(
362,"It took forever to receive the package. It fits okay. If you reopened your store, I never would have bought it."
363,Size 12 (45) runs half a size bigger. Still wearable. (Im size 12 in ultraboost and 11.5 in stan smiths)
364,Beautiful. Outstanding quality & true to size fit. I will definitely order from Quinn in the future.
365,"Love the scarf I ordered as a gift for our daughter, so much so I ordered one for myself!!!!"
366,"Excellent service, excellent product, excellent deliver of product."
367,"Great quality and helpful, fast customer service!"
368,The products are if excellent quality.
369,Material inferior .
370,"I wanted a Vigilante town coat to wear to school just to be the best dressed man, but they didn't have it. I was concerned about their low supply, so I waited and waited. The long process of waiting is more than a year now. I'm very disappointed at historical emporium. They try to find excuses to make it sound like they're extremely busy by blaming it on the pandemic."
371,"So I ordered a gun belt and 2 holsters from this website and I ordered everything on the 22nd of July and it took until the 5th of September to arrive. It took 45 days give or take to arrive, and when the gun belt and holsters arrived the gun belt didn‚Äôt fit me. Now I‚Äôm a 34 waist and I haven‚Äôt gained or lost any weight or changed waist size but I was very displeased when it arrived and it didn‚Äôt even fit! I haven‚Äôt brought this up with the company because I know I would just be smacked with a huge return package bill to only be refunded half of the amount I paid because of the cost of shipping that apparently takes 45 days to get to me. The only reason I‚Äôve given them 2/5 is because the person I was emailing was very helpful. Oh and one last thing, I had to pay half of the amount of the order to customs for the package. Unhappy to say the least."
372,"I agree that they are overpriced and out of stock on many things. I had to buy the item I wanted in a medium even though I wear small or x-small. And even the medium was ""special order""I also read on Reddit that, as the person below me says as well, the brands they sell are actually much cheaper and they mark them up enormously. But what I'm most upset about is the lack of warning that there would be a large customs bill delivering to Canada. I order so many packages that never charge me customs that I forgot it was even a thing. Now I have this $50 bill for something I didn't even want... I was given a gift certificate for Historical Emporium so I used it because why not. I didn't expect this huge bill to receive it. I want to send the item back now and I just know it's going to be a huge headache to deal with trying to get it sent back. NOT impressed."
373,"I have ordered several items from Historical Emporium, and never been disappointed. Everything I‚Äôve ordered has been of high quality, durable, fits well, comfortable. Excellent customer service and quick delivery (I live fewer than 100 miles from their location). I frequently get compliments on their products. Historical Emporium clothing is one of the mainstays of my wardrobe."
374,"I ordered two top hats, both the same size.  One was too small.  Very disappointed to learn that I would need to spend $54 to ship back the hat.  Deceptive return policy, and poor size descriptions.  While I like the clothing, I will not shop with this vendor again due to their return policy."
375,"At first glance, Historical Emporium seems like a dream come true for victorian clothing enthusiasts. However after the initial glee of browsing through their decent selection of reproduction clothing, one my come to realize that Historical Emporium largely is just a resale mark up of Wah maker and frontier classic brands. While that is understandable, and forgivable. What I can not stand is the complete lack of stock in normal or smaller sizes. Nearly every item in their Catalog is out of stock in any size below obese. And this happens fairly quickly as well. You would think that they would order larger batches of the smaller sizes that sell out.Long story short, I do not see myself giving any more business to The over priced Historical Emporium even if they had something in my size."
376,I ask for why they dont ship to Spain (when they are shipping to the other european countries )and i discovered that they think that all of us are buglars and cheaters. Awfull and insulting by the way
377,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I strongly recommend steering clear of this company. They have zero respect for history or those who lived it.I ordered a model ship of the USS Des Moines from them via Amazon. I placed the order for my 83 year old grandfather who served on the USS Des Moines more than 60 years ago. He was so excited to have and work on a model of this decommissioned ship that he has so many memories of. We eagerly awaited its arrival and when it finally came we opened the box to find... the wrong ship.When I submitted the return request, The History Store told me that if I sent it directly back to them, they would send the correct ship (instead of just getting a refund through Amazon). They sent me a shipping label that I brought, along with the ship, to The UPS Store. As with any Amazon return, they said they would take care of sending it back.A few days later, I was given a $60 refund. When I inquired about the replacement ship, I was told by The History Store that they would not be sending one. They claimed that the product was not packaged correctly for return and could no longer be sold as new. Because of this, they charged me a $90 restocking fee and refunded the remaining $60.Amazon reached out to the seller on my behalf to explain the situation and request that the full amount be refunded. The History Store refused and suggested that I take it up with the UPS Store. I couldn't do that as The UPS Store requires pictures of the damaged package as well as other details they would have (as the ones that paid for the shipping and received the package). When I pointed this out to them, I received no response.Overall, The History Store provided absolutely appalling customer service, especially given the fact that they sent the wrong product to begin with. My grandfather still does not have his ship. We'll be looking to purchase one from a different seller."
378,"Great selection of Wild West, steampunk and Victorian clothing. I ordered one of their steampunk getups for Halloween and loved my outfit."
379,"I placed one star here because it's the only way I can write a review. Beware of ordering from here. Period. Two ""single""  cotton hankerchiefs, totaling $26.00. They are selling items at 3X to 4X cost and are not who you THINK you have placed your order thru, which is BELK stores. BELK should be ashamed of their poor vendor (marketplace) selections. If you order from BELK on-line... Beware! Cannot reach this company by phone. Cannot return items. Cannot get help from BELK either. Thank goodness only $26.00 and not a large purchase. Thank goodness."
380,"Do not shop at this company.  I tried calling to ask a few questions about a $6,000.00 order I was going to place.  I tried over 20 times on different days and times, BUT no one would answer the phone except a Robot.Poor Customer Service so I will spend my money elsewhere."
381,"Ordered a ""pajama set"", only the top came and the color was so vastly different than what was on their website, which looked more like a bluish grey. The pajama set was overpriced anyway.. feel sick to my stomach to have blown over $35 for nothing. Too many liars and thieves in this world, that's for sure!"
382,"I ordered 2 stretch braided belts (identical to the one I already own, just different color) in size M 34-36. When they arrived it was obvious that they were mis-labeled & actually were closer to a size L 40+. I sent them back via Wal-Mart. Now I'm being charged a return shipping fee for their mis-labeled product. On-line customer chat choose to ignore my request for assistance & closed that chat conversation w?o any assistance. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I'd give no stars if possible."
383,"Immediately after purchasing, I called to cancel. I left a voice mail with my name, order number and return phone number. Got no reply. I then sent 2 emails asking to please cancel. NO REPLY. I had to go through PayPal before they deigned to answer me, to which they replied that they never received anything  from me asking to cancel. This is absolutely unacceptable. They tell you right on their website to call if you need to cancel. What's the point?! I do NOT recommend this company. They took 4 days before even shipping, yet told me it was shipped and they cannot cancel now. Maybe if you would have replied when first contacted, you could have canceled the item. Negligent"
384,SCAM! SCAM! SCAM!I received nothing but paid over 150$!No answer from the company!
385,"I paid 100 ‚Ç¨ for my order, and after the confirmation email (more than 50 days ago), I have not received anything. I tried to contact them, but they don't respond."
386,"This is a terrible company with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They shipped my order to the wrong country, refused to correct their mistake and stopped answering their emails. I finally managed to get my order sent to me (no thanks to this company) and the pants I ordered are about 6 inches too short! Do yourself a favor and avoid them like the plague."
387,"Placed my order on 2nd march 2020. Shirt never arrived. email their customer service but recieved reply that the domain no longer exists. The website matchutailor.com is also kot found. I have ordered several shirts previously without issues. I suspect covid19 has cause it to go bust. However, i think the company should at least announce on their site. Wondering is there any channels for me to lodye a compain?"
388,"Slim fit shirts are really very fitting. You may want to put a slightly higher weight if you don't want a very fitting shirt, but still slim fit. Website also honoured its perfect fit guarantee and helped me remake a shirt that wasn't fitting around the neck. The bamboo cotton shirts are of good price-to-value ratio."
389,"It actually worked!I was skeptical that with the few dimensions they asked for it would actually fit. But, for once in my life, I have some collared shirts that fit well. The neck collar was a little big, which I'll adjust for the next time I order with them. I'll definitely be getting more things!"
390,"I ordered shirts on Jan 1, 2020. No problem in charging my credit card.  I recevied an invoice and was told I would receive an expected date I would receive my shirts.  No confirmation came.  Emailed on Jan 22 inquiring about my order.  No response.  Emailed again Jan 27th and received an automated response someone would get back to me. No follow-up.  Called the PH # on their website (213) 785-8151; appears to be disconnected as it did not even ring.At best they have gone out of business and have no staffing.  At worst, this is a scam.Save time and aggravation, do not order from them."
391,Purchased for 300 USD. I never got any item which I ordered. Not any response on my request. Do NOT purchase there. SCAAAAM
392,"Nice and easy experience, would like to see more options for guests to punch in all the different sizes from a previous shirt they have. Also better pictures for the two collar monogram locations. I could not understand where they are."
393,Shirt is really poor quality and material for the cost of it. I didn‚Äôt feel like they actually used the fits I typed in. Do t waste your money for this cost you could go to a tailor in the UK
394,"Shirts fits like a glove but a little tight in the chest so as to make a gap in the placket. Took 19 days from order date to deliver, which seems normal for a custom shirt."
395,I've placed my order nearly 1 month ago and still haven't received it.Your website's chat does not respond to my questions.I'm beginning to think this site is a scam!
396,"Amazing service, great quality will order again. The delivery took a month knowing that I ordered from France. It is the only downside. Still, it was worth the wait."
397,"It was great, the process was easy, I really loved it. The only thing I would like to improve is customer service, but besides that, I really recommend it."
398,You should provide better customer services like chatting with customer care. They dont respond at all. And features like return and track.
399,Terrible shipping... Have not recieved my shirt in over a month. They have no control over their sales and terrible customer support.
400,"Somehow the jacket fits perfectly, the system the measure with is just amazing.  I've never had a jacket fit so well."
401,my sleeves was a little shortEdit: Got a new shirt (free of charge) that fit perfectly after a couple of weeks.
402,My replenish shirt never arrived. They dont answer after. It is a scam do not buy. Trust me
403,the suit was received earlier than estimated. I received the product I chose.
404,"Terrible customer support and return policy, I bought the same pair of shorts as I have and they are smaller.They have refused to issue a refund even though I have send the product back to them over a month ago.Will never buy again and strongly suggest you do not buy either."
405,I ordered a 34/34 in pants and they sent a 36/30. Really? Why not check what you are packing against the actual order?
406,The pants fall apart after a few washings and the zippers break easily on the pockets.  Customer service is terrible and this company is garbage. Don't waste your money.
407,Terrible customer service and impossible to make returns or exchanges.So unimpressed and while their clothes arent bad I will no longer be a customer for this reason. It's just not worth it.
408,"I ordered two pairs of pants and two shirts on a Wednesday morning, and opted to pay for express two day shipping because I needed the items for a work trip the following week. My items are somehow scheduled to be delivered six days from my confirmation purchase date. I contacted customer service and their response was that fed ex doesn‚Äôt deliver on weekends, although two day shipping should‚Äôve had my parcel arrive on Friday. I contacted fed ex, and they deliver to my address on weekends. I am both confused and appalled. I like their clothing, but cannot recommend based on their customer service."
409,Buyer beware!!!  If you have to return any clothing (and you likely will) not only does postage cost $30 but Public Rec will then claim to have not received your parcel.  This company is a scam.  I have read multiple reviews describing the same scenario.  They are hoping you will just give up so they can keep you money and your clothing.
410,"I hate to sound rude but I had good expectations for the edp, but they are not fully thinking about us short people. I ordered a 32x28 and the ankle opening was so large! I stood and it just looked like mom jeans. It was not really slim tapered as expected. Sure if I paid 20 bucks whatever but this pant is over 100usd and it fits like pant from target. It‚Äôs a good thing I returned it."
411,"Purchased two pairs of of the same workday pant. Upon arrival, one of the items was size labelled incorrectly as it was clearly a size or two smaller than the label read. I printed out the PR return label and promptly sent back requesting a replacement of the same pant in the correct size. Waited.... no pants and follow up with PR representatives and they can‚Äôt find my return?? Now, out of pocket for cost of the pants plus return shipping and no product. Good product but this company needs to improve their quality control and business processes. I do not recommend this company"
412,"I ordered 2 pants for gifts for men. Adult pant did not fit true to size to what was worn in other brands. They were tight in the crotch and uncomfortable. The material might have been okay, but the fit was off. The other pair was for a teen and also tighter in all areas for a very thin youth. No wonder the pants were on sale! Here is the rub, the pants can't be returned. They claim the ad said no returns. So buyer beware."
413,Terrible quality product! I bought a pair and wore them and realized the pockets were not completely finished and I lost a personal keepsake that fell out of the pocket. I contacted them and they could have cared less about my losing something very personal to me due to their TERRIBLE quality control. Never will buy again!
414,I have 2 pair of the everyday pants and I like them a lot. I ordered another pair that were on sale the same size as my other 2 pair and I received pants that say they are my size but they are about 2 sizes smaller on the waist. Poor quality control! Or they are dumping the mismarked pants onto its customers. Since they were on sale no return!!! BS!
415,It took 3.5 weeks for it to arrive and I was greatly irritated by this but the product was more than enough to offset damage done by their poor delivery.   I bought the everyday pant in a 30 / 30 which fits perfectly.   Very comfortable and stretchy.   They would have received a 5 but the delivery took a week or longer then it should have.
416,Great service and product!! I inquired about a military discount and was advised that none was offered but they did give me a special discount which I greatly appreciated.  They responded quickly and I ordered the pants.  Pants came within 3 days. The fit was perfect and the material is top quality. I will order more pants in the future.  Thank you!!
417,"EDIT: I appreciate the response, I have updated the rating, since the pants were pretty nice once I got them. It must have been a terrible coincidence.OLD: I haven't got my clothes yet, but ever since I submitted the form with my phone number, I have been getting telemarketing calls non stop.I can't say for sure if it's related, but it is an awful coincidence and it makes me think you're selling everyone's data for profit."
418,"I have purchased several times from this company. I always order the same size. They had a clearance sale and when I received those 2 pair of pants they were clearly sized or labeled incorrectly, about 2 sizes too small. I did not want a refund, just to exchange for the size I ordered. They said exchanges to clearance items and wouldn't even check them out to see that they were not correctly labeled.This is not not a company that has any interest in having satisfied, repeat customers and this was likely a scam to clear out overstocked or perviously returned items."
419,"Really disappointed because I had such a strong start with this company. Honestly, I do think their joggers are generally great fitting, super fashionable colorways and nice material.That being said...this is now my 2nd pair though that after 1 single wash (and a single wear in this instance, mind you), it comes out with crazy notable stretch marks in the material. Terrible QC.I reached out and was told I could not return or exchange as I'm outside of the window and the best they could offer is 20% on new orders.50% of my purchases here have has this issue...no thanks."
420,"Fantastic pants!! I have the ADED and I‚Äôm a big lad and they fit great, are stretchy without being baggy, look good and feel fantastic! They wash well and dry fast. I‚Äôm after buying a bunch more now including the Workday Pant to try out! It was a small gamble buying online, sight unseen, especially when getting pants which can be notoriously tricky to get right; but it paid off big time! New favourite pants now!"
421,"I am a big fan of Public Rec clothing. Fit is a big deal for me. I am tall and thin and the fact that I can choose my waist and inseam sizes on their pants is not easy to come by with other brands. Especially with zippered pockets. The ADED pants are perfect for what I need. I can wear them to work and home. With the faux fly in front and non-baggy fit, they look like a dressier pant but are soft and comfortable as any sweat pant."
422,"A few years back, I bought a pair of the ""all day every day"" pant and within 1 year, the under-crotch seam opened up about 3 inches. These $98 or so pants do not leave the house anymore. Even today, it seems as though PRec is still evolving in their designs, materials, and quality when us customers would have expected these things to have already been fine-tuned prior to release- especially at this price point."
423,"I love the Public Rec clothing line!  My adult daughter bought me a Polo for Christmas and I love the fit and fabric.  I've since bought several Go To Crews, Polos, long sleeve casual shirts and pants.  They all fit great, keep their shape, are easy to wash and don't wrinkle up.  You can wear them to the office, casually with friends and just around the house.  I recommend giving them a try!  You won't be disappointed!"
424,"This was only the send time I ordered from Public Rec but I liked their pants so I wanted to order some shorts.  This was a substantial order and it was supposed to go out overnight I placed it at 10am, well I never received any shipping info so I called customer service and my order was still in their warehouse the next day.  Why have overnight as an option if you are not going to ship overnight.  Canceled the order and will take my business elsewhere."
425,Bought a pair of Public Rec joggers a few months ago. The zipper in the left pocket detached.  Was glued on instead of sewn.  I sent them back and got a store credit.  I decided to give them one more try.  Same thing happened with the next pair.  Wore them three times and the zipper detached again.  Time for a redesign of that zipper.  I recommend you spend the few cents more and have them sewn in ... or get rid of the zipper completely.
426,"I ordered a few pairs of Joggers over Black Friday. Not only was the ordering process super efficient, but I received my order in like 2 days. I have been wearing my joggers every day since. They are so comfortable and look great. I've washed a pair them as well and they came out of the laundry as good as they went in.I would 100% recommend buying them. I will certainly be buying more products in the future."
427,"Well, I am not sure about the product, but I've been having problems with a return. First,I wrote an email asking for help with a return. No response.( there's no phone #)‚Äîafter chatting with someone online  I was told that the return label will be sent to me via email . there wasnt any emails or labels. I wrote another email to the customer service ‚Äîtwo days passed‚Äînothing... This is unacceptable."
428,I should have checked reviews before placing an order. It took more than two weeks for the order to arrive. If they cant deliver the product as promised why are they in this business or atleast tell upfront of shipping delays. At least they refunded the order. Now have to go through the hassle of return.Such a bad service.
429,"I have purchased many amazing items from PublicRec over the last few years and everything is amazing quality. I recently received a defective mask (which happens from time to time). I was just contacted by a wonderful employee that has very quickly ensured that I have a new one being sent to me. Not only are their clothes amazing, but their customer service is too!"
430,"I have dealt with a lot of athletic wear companies. The quality of this product is on par with all the other big names. Very comfortable, durable, and timeless style. I had an issue with pricing on one of my orders. Their product service team was so prompt, so on the ball, and extremely quick to make things right. I left feeling like I truly mattered as a customer. They have a customer for life in me."
431,"Great fit and quality. Especially like the individualized sizing. The 30"" inseam alone is worth the purchase. ADED pants and joggers are fantastic and comfortable. So is the politan hoodie. Watch out for the Workday Pants though; I haven't had a chance to try the new ""regular"" ones, but the originals are now labeled ""slim"" and they were way too small in the calf area for anyone that works out and has calves :-)"
432,"Found a pair of ADED shorts at a thrift store and fell in love, but they were a size too small. It killed me to pay $64 more to size up, but they‚Äôre well worth it. The shorts arrived quickly, but had a very minor defect. I was met with the most seamless, polite and helpful customer service I could ask for. They stand by their product as they should, which made it easy for me to purchase two more pairs.  Support this brand and help them grow!"
433,"These pants are extremely comfortable. They fit great, look great and are bulletproof. Without a doubt the most comfortable and best pants I‚Äôve ever owned! I started with one pair and now I have five! The return experience was also perfect. I had purchased the wrong size and sent them back, immediately got back the correct pair. I‚Äôm looking forward to my next purchase!"
434,"First rate customer service and first rate clothing. I have the following; all day every day pant, all day every day jogger and three of their t-shirts. I do wish you would offer more colors in your t-shirts. All of their fabric is top notch, comfy yet classy with the flex to dress up or down depending on your occasion. Thanks for developing a great and trusted brand."
435,Bought a backpack from them and the zipper blew out within 6 months. contacted them with the expectation that they would replace after it breaking so soon...but they offered $20 to fix the zipper. yeah...not gonna work.I would strongly discourage anyone from buying their goods. I'm not sure the quality is there and they obviously don't stand behind their products if they won't replace defective merch.
436,"The ‚ÄúAll Day Every Day‚Äù pants are awesome.    I have now purchased 5 pair.   I wear these on the golf course and bowling all winter long.    When it‚Äôs not shorts weather these are my first option.  Comfortable and good looking.   A hard to beat combination.  Customer service is top notch as well.   I recently returned a pair of pants for ones more like I had previously purchased.   It was no problem.   Excellent support, help and followup."
437,I purchased pants from Public Rec and really liked them so I tried the backpack.  I used the item for about 6 months and the zippers fell off track.  The quality did not match the $180 price tag.I reached out to Public Rec and received a response same day.  They were willing to pay up to $20 for reimbursement for me to have someone fix it.  I guess it‚Äôs better than nothing but I will be sticking to pants ONLY from this company.
438,"Workday pants are the most comfortable work (and casual) pants I've ever had. I don't even want to wear jeans anymore. I own 6 pairs.That said, there is some variability in quality. I've had to return a pair for being too short (by 2 inches) and a pair for being too tight. But their customer service is excellent and my return was handled promptly."
439,"So far so good. I‚Äôm on my second pair. Honestly I haven‚Äôt worn them every day but when I do wear them they are great. I‚Äôll seriously write another review in a couple of months to tell you if the review changes. I‚Äôm a big guy, 6‚Äô4‚Äù, around 285lbs. Their biggest pants fit me really well. I actually didn‚Äôt want to take them off. Like I said I‚Äôll send a subsequent review after a number months and washes."
440,"The all day every day pants are incredible but my favorites. Are the t-shirtsAs someone. Who is confined to bed and has to be dressed I loook for clothes that are soft, easy for my wife to put on and take off of me and the shirts are perfect for me.  All I wear are t shirts and shorts because of my situation but give me a black or navy public rec shirt and I am good to go.  Keep up the good work!  You have a winner"
441,"Not impressed with the customer service or the quality of the their 'all day every day pants' at $115 delivered. They got snagged within 8 weeks on the knee and a large hole began to develop. I wasn't using them for the gym and when I contacted customer service with pictures, they offered me a 15% discount. I wasn't looking for a replacement but a 15% discount??? Lot's of choices out there for pants, Public Rec will no longer be one of them for me."
442,"I have ordered many items from Public Rec over the last few years. For my husband who loves his ADED pants and for both my sons who enjoy all their gear - including ADED pants, ADED shorts, polo shirts, joggers and new work pants.  We are a Public Rec family -  waiting to see what is coming for women!Never disappointed in quality and fit."
443,"I am 78 and still enjoy quality, versatile clothing but without the ""papa look"".  Public Rec quality is simply off-the-charts excellent, and well worth the wait due to supply constraints in the pandemic. Specifically, I give the everyday pants full marks, and thru to size (don't size up). The Henley turned out to be a bit athletic (tight) for my build, which I will return under Pubic Rec's excellent return and postage paid policy. My next step is to send my son's-in-law gift certificates so they can equally enjoy."
444,"I was shocked to see how many 1 star reviews this company got. My experience has been amazing.If you review the 1 stars, almost all are from people who don't understand that it's not standard to cover shipping on returns overseas.Anyway, I've purchased 5 pairs so far (4 ADA and 1 Work day) and they are all fantastic.This is not some dropshipping company from China. The products are unique, comfortable and they look great.Highly recommended!"
445,"Ordered the All Day Every Day pants 4 weeks ago and still hasn't arrived and I've now just been hit with an additional ¬£25 Customs Charge making these trousers stupidly expensive. I can't speak about the quality of the item yet but I don't think the Customs Charge is clear enough - I did contact Customer Service and was told its in the FAQ but in my opinion not make clear enough. All in all, not happy"
446,"I got 2 pairs of the pants because they seemed exactly what I'd like from the ads but, for the price, I was disappointed. They're heavy and baggy, not a nice fit even though I got the size I get for all my pants. Feels like wearing the bottom of a wetsuit. They definitely don't work with a shirt at work as advertised either..  They're very obviously tracksuit pants. I had high hopes but if I saw them in a store for half the price I wouldn't be interested. Thats the risk you take with online shopping I guess.."
447,"Public rec had an ‚Äúarchive‚Äù sale. It appears now that they were actually clearing out mislabeled-waist sized pants on an unsuspecting consumer base (see other reviews). The customer service claims that these are not only ‚Äúno return‚Äùbut also ‚Äúno exchange‚Äù for the correct size, even if mis labeled as to size! Then they wanted me to measure the pants and photograph them. I‚Äôm not a tailor! I‚Äôm an attorney. I‚Äôve bought 4 expensive pair of pants from them in the past. This is terrible customer service and might be fraud or theft if they knew the pants were too small in the waist and sold them to customers anyway with no exchange or return. Again, see the other reviews."
448,"I think this company has potential but the product is overpriced for what it is. I bought the workday pants and found the fit and material to be less than ideal. I returned them and subsequently bought some Calvin Klein golf pants that were almost identical, albeit a better fit, better but similar stretchy material and cheaper. The Public Rec workday pants are basically like the new generation of golf pants that are being made by Nike, CK, etc."
449,"Got a pair of the All Day Jogger. Really liked it - it was comfortable, lightweight and stylish. However barely 2 months later, the zippered pocket broke - the lining completely detached from the zipper. (It looks like it was glued, rather than sewed on).  What a bummer since the zipper was one big reason that I bought these, to keep the phone secure while jogging. At this point it was past the short 45-day exchange window, so I am stuck with a pair of jogger that I am now using as pajamas."
450,"The quality of material on the workday pant is not quite on par with lululemon (these pants cost about $20 less). That being said I absolutely LOVE the fit of these pants. They leave you room in the thigh and a nice taper down the calf, exactly what I was looking for. Some of the stitching around the leg opening is already unraveling after a few wears. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how long these pants are going to last but i will enjoy them as long as they do."
451,"I returned two items on 12/1/19 at the direction of Public Rec using their shipping company. As of today, 12/22 the package still shows in-transit and Public Rec refuses to refund the money based on lost shipping. What‚Äôs more, they want me to call their shipping choice and find the package. I will never buy anything from here again."
452,"This is the only thing that‚Äôs annoying about buying online and from overseas. My new pants are awesome in every respect but they‚Äôre oversized for their stated sizing IMO. I‚Äôd normally just send them back and get the correct size but by the time I post back internationally it‚Äôs simply not worth it. It just adds to the final cost way too much. So public rec, how about offering people internationally who need to return but don‚Äôt a discount on a second pair!!"
453,"Like other reviewers here, I ordered from the UK and there was NO pre-notification of the additional customs charges that would be levied. Not just that, but the Post Office in the UK also add a surcharge for the fact that there is a customs charge to pay!  This added ¬£25 to the cost for something that just simply wasn't worth it.The quality of the item is standard and not worthy of the rave reviews the company use to advertise their clothing."
454,"Regardless of the product, the additional ¬£37 tax duty to the UK and the incredibly poor 'computer says no' communication from the customer service team means this is a brand to avoid.They are not set up to deliver internationally so they should stick to the US.  BTW, the reviews on the official website (over 2000) are all 4 and 5 stars.  I posted a different rating, but they decided not to post it. This is clearly selective and frankly dishonest!"
455,"I sold men's clothing for many years, and I know my sizes. I ordered a pair size 31/32. What I got was more like 32/34. Way to big for me. I returned (Postage Paid) and got the 30/30 pair today. Took them out of the bag and found a pull on the upper inside thigh. The waist fits better, but I'm not too sure about the fabric, and they are still too long. The pants are"" OK"", but way overpriced. I was planning on buying a matching jacket, but I have changed my mind!"
456,"Public Rec is a quality shop.  There were some sizing and shipping issues but they were able to work those out and make me 100% happy with their product.  I've purchased Henley's, Everyday Pants, and most recently workday pants.  All are comfortable and I get compliments on the daily.  Sometimes there are issues with online orders.  The Public Rec team turned the issues into an opportunity to shine as a support org.  Thanks folks.  I will continue to be your customer and advocate. - Joe"
457,"Just had a pair of these shipped to the Uk. Unfortunately i was not in so the postman left a calling card although stipulated I had to pay a ¬£25 customs charge to pick them up? What?! I‚Äôve never had to do this in the history of buying anything from the internet. Be very careful this company are not truthful at all and have hidden these charges,"
458,"After having an issue with a pair of pants then waiting a while for a response (which I now understand may not have been their fault) I am really happy to be leaving this review. Public Rec‚Äôs customer team, specifically John, offered an extremely generous resolution to a relatively frustrating situation. I am very appreciative of their help, and really do look forward to being a continued customer of theirs for a long time. I plan on placing my next order today.Heavily recommend their gear!"
459,"I was not notified that my goods were waiting for collection at the local post office? They need to seriously look at their delivery methods to the UK. over one month for delivery. Also another ¬£22 in VAT on top of the already expensive $95 made these pants very very expensive. Not worth the money for the quality and over one month waiting for delivery. I would advise anyone thinking of buying these ""All Day Every Day Pants"" give it a miss. Poor customer service"
460,The only thing remarkable and innovative about Public Rec apparel is the companies marketing effort that convinces gullible suckers to buy simple unremarkable clothing marked up 10 or 20 times the price any rational person would spend on leisure wear.
461,Don't get suckered.  The reviews are fake.  They only sell on their website because sites like Amazon require them to leave up real reviews that are negative!  Most of the articles are b.s. fake articles that are paid promos.  The materials are cheap Chinese junk -- this is all slick marketing for $5 pants that they sell as revolutionary.
462,"My fianc√© is obsessed with the ADED pant which says a lot because he considers himself a sweatpants aficionado. He wears them everywhere we go! He was looking for a more fitted, tapered pair of sweatpants and he definitely found them in the ADED pant. They fit perfectly and he raves about how comfortable they are. We will definitely be buying more."
463,"Have sent pants back for return 2 months ago, have been emailing them to get my refund but they're  not even replying to me. Not a SINGLE reply after multiple emails over the last month. Not even to acknowledge my emails. Pants fit like cheap tights rather than pants. Atrocious customer service. Return my money!!!!!!"
464,Really expensive and poor quality. After the second wash and line dry the front zipped pocket hem came away. Was surprised to see that traditional stitching had not been used and garment glue as a cheap alternative. Upon requesting a refund or replacement I was told that I would have to send the faulty joggers back at my own expense. Not good given I live in the UK. Most companies who are organised and professional would supply a return shipping label. Bad customer service for international customers.
465,(Edited)Public Rec took a full month to deliver two items. Both were incorrect. Neither products nor sizes were correct. Now I have to go through the bother of returning the delivered items. I wonder whether I will ever receive my refund. They should be refunding me for the waste of my time as well. ---Public Rec has now responded to my review with a nonsensical apology about shipping delays that does not address the fact that I RECEIVED THE WRONG PRODUCTS and have to spend time to return them without any further compensation.
466,"Love the pants and these are the third pair that I have purchased from them. On the customer service side, the last order went wrong with UPS losing my package. Rather than wait on them to figure out their mistake, PublicRec went ahead and replaced them (using FedEx this time) and the pants arrived on time."
467,"I will try to keep this simple. Their clothes are expensive....BUT, they are more comfortable than anything I own or have tried on. There was a time when i thought people who paid close to $100 for pants were insane and now I own seven different pairs between the ADED and Workday pant. If you want quality you have to pay for quality.  Their customer service has always been quick to respond and more than reasonable when I had questions or concerns. Let‚Äôs face it, no company is perfect but Public Rec is close."
468,"The product is amazing!  It makes a middle aged man feel young, sporty and professional.  I have literally worn my all day joggers to business meetings, during video shoots, etc.  Hands down the most comfortable pant I have ever worn.  Get yourself a pair now!"
469,"I work from home and the AllDayEveryDay Pant and Jogger are the most comfortable pants I have EVERY worn.  I have turned all my family and friends on to them and they all agree.  Stylish too.  Need to run out for a coffee or meet a friend for lunch,  never even think about needing to change clothes."
470,"I made a large Christmas 2019 purchase for my Dad, brother and boyfriend from Public rec. It took 2 days for a Holiday season delivery. AMAZING! The All Day Everyday pants were such a hit with my Dad, I purchased him a new color for his birthday in March. The response time from Public Rec is faster than any company I have used before. I had to exchange for a different size and it only took 3 days to obtain the new size, I don‚Äôt think they had received the ones I had returned yet! Thanks Public Rec, can‚Äôt wait for the women‚Äôs line!"
471,"Bought these pants on 21st November they shipped on 24th waited till 17th December and here comes surprise on18th you have an item to pay ¬£59.15 duties when contacted customer service been informed if I have paid duties at the time of purchase I shouldn't have to pay duties.... excuse me.... you should have to make provision while checking out how much I'd have to pay.... although I paid shipment and extremely costly pair of pants USD 171 for two pants an additional¬£59 guys beware of this online scams...,."
472,"They sent me the wrong pants after speaking to them to make sure I was getting the right ones. When I told them they said when you buy your next pair we will give you 10% off. The bank did the leaves they didn‚Äôt have a zip fly as they told me and no belt loops. They sent the wrong pants and then told me I couldn‚Äôt return them and expected me to buy another pair. These guys are a rip off don‚Äôt be fooled! They promise to make it right;but, they have done nothing more!Please, don‚Äôt BS me, there is too much of that these days!"
473,I recently purchased two pair of Workday shorts. Like other pants I have purchased from Public Rec they fit and feel fantastic. I have the long pants and the All Day Every Day shorts. All are top drawer clothes. I wear them all for dress or casual. I love the materials they‚Äôre made of.
474,"I really like the public rec pants I received today. Unfortunately CHF taxes were charged by Swiss Customs, but 1 email and 2 hours later the problem is solved and I got my reimbursement mail from PayPal üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª great service!"
475,Ordered 2 pants and 1 short. Delivery expected within 15 workdays. I am already waiting over 30 workdays and have not received anything yet. Public Rec says that my package apparently was not scanned and now is lost. I demanded a refund but Public Rec refuses to do so because they want to claim it first at their insurance partner. What kind of crappy service is this? Public Rec is responsible for delivering me the order I paid for. And if it is ‚Äòlost‚Äô you have to refund me first and than fight with your own insurance. Crappy company!
476,"I own 4 pair of ADED Pants, one ADED Jogger Pant, and 4 pairs of Workday Pants. I love them. The Workday Pant is perfect for my job...I teach Acting and Voice at a major state university, and can go from a meeting straight into the studio to lead a physical warm-up. They're perfect!"
477,"I love the all day everyday pants except for the zippered front pockets.  Maybe put a security zipper on a back pocket, not the front.  Unzipped the front pockets look tacky.  Zipped, it takes two hands to get it.Comfort, fit, fabric, all terrific!  Could the zippers be optional?"
478,I wrote the last one star review 3 days ago. Someone responded to make it appear they cared. Telling me to reach back out to support and they would work with me. Publicly you try to look good customer service wise but privately you don‚Äôt care at all. Pretty weak way to run a business.
479,I have made multiple purchases from public rec following a lengthy search for super comfort. They are the best quality and amazing to wear. It‚Äôs Ll I seem to wear during lockdown.Delivery from US is not the quickest but a few weeks and it‚Äôs worth the wait.
480,"I have a pair of ADED and their sweats. It's a good product, but I had to buy them from eBay since I'm in Canada. The site will show the price in CDN currency, but they won't mention the import and duty aren't covered until checkout.Otherwise I would give a higher score."
481,For UK customers - avoid !!! Even if they ship you a wrong size or colour you need to pay for return to US either by yourself or via their DHL return label - ¬£18.The quality is not different from a local Primark
482,"They are very good joggers/pants/trousers and you can chose your length which is great.  I work from home, have a toddler and a busy life and also like to work out.  With these you can keep them on all day for all those activities as well as lounge at home. Be careful when ordering, as if you live abroad, you will have to pay taxes when the shipment arrives, or pay upfront at checkout.  Also, make sure you choose your payment currency.The product is really good, I would distribute for them in the UK to be honest and I have just ordered 2 more pairs."
483,I love these pants!! They are hands down the most comfortable pants I own and I will for sure be buying many more in different colors!!! They are the perfect everyday pant and I get compliments every time I wear them!! Thank you Public Rec for making my butt look good!
484,"I have bought 2 pair of of pants from Public Rec.  I am a regular wearer of loose fit non belt requiring casual pants.   Saw an ad for Public Rec and thought I'd try one.  They were a bit more than I usually pay but thought I'd check them out.They turned out to be so much better in quality than any of the others.  The fabric is quality and slightly stretch.   But I LOVED the pockets, which, unlike many others, are deep and close with quality zippers.   They also have a decent back pocket.I've since bought more of these.   They launder easily and I can recommend them to anyone."
485,The quality of the pants is remarkable! They fit great and look great! I have three of these so far. I travel a lot. Flights with same day returns. Mostly for work. These pants added level of comfort during my travel experiences. Next on my list is your Go-To Polo! :)
486,"I purchased my first pair of pants about a year ago, and am now awaiting delivery of my 5th pair.  They are just so very comfortable yet at the same time stylish and functional. Truly, you can go anywhere in them.  Also wonderful for our present lockdown."
487,"Ordered the ADEDP which are great. Super fit, very comfortable. However I was charged ¬£23 for a customs charge on top of the already expensive cost for the trousers! This was not mentioned to me at any point so beware. Also International shipping takes ages!"
488,"Received the ""All Day Every Day Jogger"" 30/30 in the dark olive color as a white elephant gift. The pants fit loose at first (I'm normally a 32/30), so I thought ""the pants will probably stretch."" So I went my day today squatting a couple of times to tie my shoes, pick up my pen, etc. The moment I took these off, I notice a large gaping hole at the seam near the butt. What in the world? I would avoid this company. The website looks kind of sketchy too. Thrown in the trash.Edit: Contacted them via email. As expected, not helpful lol. Hard to trust a company that doesn‚Äôt try to make things right."
489,I purchase your product less then 4 months ago and reached out to your support team  about the button hole starting to rip and frey and the gray plastic around the button hole has snapped off  ripping and the response I received was to take it to a seamstress and have it repaired and I would be reimbursed up to $15 for the repair instead of an exchange. Now the gray plastic around the button hole has all black thread threw it and they do not look like when I purchased them from public rec less then 4 months ago I will never purchase a product from a company that can't stand by the product they produce its bad business
490,"First of all, I don't understand all these negative reviews from international buyers. If I buy something from out of the country, I certainly know if duty is charged and I would have factored that in to the price.  Secondly, have you tried these pants on.  They are fantastic! They look great, feel great and I get nothing but compliments. I was a little annoyed that they ran out of stock but that's a sign that these things are very popular. I now own 8 pair and they are my favorite pants All Day, Every Day and all the Days in between!!!  And, oh yes, I'm most definitely not a fake review!"
491,"The shock I had when I opened the shipment is that the Public Rec Work Day pants uses pretty much the same quality material than the 245euros Porsche Design Tec Travel pants !!!! Not only that, the Work Day pants' cut is better than Porsche Design. I was in Hamburg, Germany last May and I am glad that P.D. did not have my size. I am not trying to bad mouth P.D. because I own lots of clothing from them. However, the Public Rec Work Day pants at 108USD is a deal !!! I love the fit, the comfort and the looks. I am likely to buy at least another pair in a different color such as the new dark olive."
492,The workday pants are the best pants I ever owned!! I have 7 pairs and ordering more. Comfortable for work behind a desk as a district manager and still stylish for night life!  I would recommend these to anybody! Don‚Äôt stop making these pantsJohnny
493,Great company with great products!  Everything me and my family have purchased have been exactly as described. Customer service is excellent and shipment has always been speedy. Highly recommended and certainly intend to purchase more in the future.
494,Placed an order for a pant and a shirt and received confirmation and a tracking nr: for over 14 days now goods are not moving out of their warehouse??Sent three mails to follow up but no reply at all! It‚Äôs a SCAM!!! Don‚Äôt buy from these amateurs.
495,The material of these pants looks nice and felt good. However if you have thighs or glutes that even thinking about being large these pants are not for you. I‚Äôm 6‚Äù 195lbs and I ordered the size recommended based on my Jean size and their fitting chart but they fit like leggings around both my thighs and calves. I returned them for a larger size but they are unwearable with the waist that large to make room for my legs. Also they have a rather high waist (think mom jeans).  For the crotch to fit properly I had to pull them up to my belly button.Maybe they are designed to fit ‚Äúskinny‚Äù but the ads photos are misleading.
496,I purchased a pair of jeans from this site...they looked amazing on the model...but the jeans I got from Daypants were paper thin and as cheap as you could ever imagine. I am very disappointed.  And want my full refund on this product
497,"Unfortunately the same experience as many others. Initially very positive but aded pants seams came loose after a handful of wears. Offered a token amount for tailoring repairs. Ridiculous given how soon this happened.Trash quality, expensive price. Do not buy and don‚Äôt be conned like us silly sods all posting here on trust pilot with the exact same issuesAlso, let‚Äôs talk about sizes. I went down two sizes from my normal pant size and the damn things still won‚Äôt stay up. Edit, going down from 2 to 1 star. Despite public rec admitting the pants are defective they won‚Äôt take a return and refund. I have to accept an exchange."
498,"Can‚Äôt say enough about their clothing that hasn‚Äôt been already said.  I have purchased 2 ADED, along with  4 Joggers and 2 pair of shorts.  They are the most comfortable fitting clothing on the market.  As you may notice, I‚Äôm a huge fan."
499,"Bought 2 pair of pants 1 everyday 1 and work pants. Ordered both the same size. Work pant is at least 1-2"" shorter than the everyday pant. Also after wearing the everyday pant for 3 hours they stretched and bagged out. Not impressed at all.."
500,My absolute favorite clothing company. Period. Public Rec is basically all I wear. Fit is superb. Materials are top quality and style is perfect for casual business to weekend comfort. Cannot day enough positive things about this brand!
501,"I really like the Public Rec pants and shorts I have purchased.  Sizing is just right and the fabrics work and wear well.  Fit for me is always a challenge, but the PR slacks always fit me perfectly.  I strongly recommend their apparel."
502,"The quality of their products is only superseded by the quality of the people at Public Rec. Great brand, vision, and values. As an influencer (do not fact check that), I cannot recommend PRec enough to friends, family, and strangers."
503,"Just received my partners order, wrong size and received 2 pairs instead of the one pair we ordered and paid for‚Ä¶.Someone obviously has our size 32 waist and we have received 2pairs of size 42 waist‚Ä¶..????"
504,Never buy in South Africa !!!!What a surprise this morning ! I need to pay 56 dollars customs fees to release the parcel.(after 7weeks shipping)I did not saw any warnings when I bought on line !!! Very bad customer experience services!!!!!
505,"If you have ever dreamed of being a superhero buy The Everyday Pant and you will instantly become ‚ÄúThe Human Lintbrush‚Äù. I kid you not, I have never seen anything like it. I received a pair as a Christmas gift, tried them on, thought that they were so great, that I was ready to order a second pair in a different color. Then I wore them. Within 30 minutes, every fiber, hair, and piece of dust within a square mile was part of my wardrobe. Other than that, I love the feel, fit, design, it‚Äôs sad. I just took them out of the wash for the third time since I‚Äôve had them, and at this point, we are going to have to part ways. Even when I‚Äôm home alone, I can‚Äôt stand to look at myself in them."
506,I received two pairs of the All Day Every Day pants as gifts and they have become my go to pants for hanging around the house or working out. Customer service was excellent in replacing for another size. love my Public Rec pants!
507,"I started with a pair of aded pants and now own a pair in almost every color, moved on and bought there polo and now buying the tee shirts.  I also own 2 pairs of shorts.  I have also bought aded pants for both my older kids.  Are they expensive, yes! Are they worth it Yes! Most comfortable pants you will ever wear and they hold up well. I have a few pairs well over 2 years and they look as good as the new ones I just bought.   I am tall so I appreciate odd sizing like 34x36 pants.  Never had an issue or defect with the clothing.  Overall this is an amazing brand and can not recommend highly enough. Last thing zippered front pockets genius. I lose my phone out of my pant's but not my public recs"
508,"Buyer beware. Customer or shall I say former customer. Received item, did not fit, returned immediately. Several weeks later receive an email telling me they are damaged and will not take my return! This company is a total scam."
509,"This company is full of BS fake reviews. As of Jan 14, 2019 their website has 1,650 reviews for the pants and almost all were fake.  The most obvious giveaway is that exactly ZERO of them are 1,2 or 3 star. Even though the pants are overpriced.  Read them, done by an ad person who tries to hard to make up stories.  And finally, check out the first review on this site, on June 6, 2018.  That day there happens to be 3 5-star reviews that pop-up, all so glowing. Then nobody likes them again on this site.   I wouldn't be surprised if some 2 and 3 stars show up on their own website today, since they'll now realize how their fake reviews are too fake!"
510,"Unfortunately, after 3 months, the seems in the pants broke up causing a gap in the seem. There are three other areas the seem has also broke. They did offer $15 for a tailor, but I would expect $100 pair of pants to last longer."
511,I've got four pairs of the Every Day Pant and two in the shorts.  I've had them for almost a year now.  I really like both the pants and the shorts and would recommend them to anyone.  The zips were a little stiff to begin with but have loosened up with wear.  The fabric is wearing well with no signs of pilling.My only gripe with this company is the after sales back up and the lack of product in stock.  My last delivery took over 6 weeks. (Australia) I sent 3 e-mails and left two voice messages on their phone and not a single person got back to me.  Also often I go onsite to order something and it just isn't in stock which is damned inconvenient.
512,"Poor quality fabric, strange fit so they look like tights on the legs while being lose on the waist.Slow shipping. Extremely expensive for the cheap product it is. And now I have to pay for my own return international shipping."
513,"The overwhelming amount of 5 stars reviews on their website are not fake. Rather speaks of the quality and the comfortable feel of their products. I was sold on my first purchase. Ok it is expensive, but totally worth it!"
514,I have purchased three pairs of pants from Public Rec with 100% satisfaction.  The pants were well constructed and extremely comfortable.  They wash well and are my go to pants for both casual and even dressier occasions.
515,"I am concerned that the negative reviews on their famed ADED pant won‚Äôt be posted to their website, tsk I‚Äôm writing here. I bought these pants six months ago and the material is beginning to deteriorate and become pilly like you would expect from some $15 generic sweatpants not $100 public rec pants. I reached to customer service with some back and forth they offered me 10% off a future order. In short the quality leaves much to be desired and they don‚Äôt stand behind their products to allow me to exchange them. The email I got said that I purchased my pants ‚Äúway back in May (2020)‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry if I expect $100 pants to last six months without feeling like my old high school sweats. Buyer beware."
516,"The clothes fit really well, look great and last. I have brought everything from tops to pants to backpacks. I have not found any t-shirts or polo shirts that come close to the Public Rec look and feel."
517,"DO NOT BUY FROM PUBLIC REC, PARTICULARLY IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THE US!I bought 4 pairs costing me AUD$728.The quality is terrible (think 1990‚Äôs flammable sweat pants), they‚Äôre not tapered or fitted, both the Work Pant (I bought 2) and EveryDay Pant (I bought 2) are baggy and poorly made. So I return the 4 pants at a cost of AUD$62 as there are no free returns (unlike MatchesFashion and Mr Porter). So I‚Äôm now out of pocket for an awful product for a total of AUD$790My ‚Äòrefund‚Äô amount from Public Rec....AUD$595.Terrible product, awful service and basically fraud.I‚Äôll be sharing my experience on all social platforms as well as TrustPilot and Reddit.The more victims I can save from this scam the better."
518,"I ordered pants that were damaged in transit, ie, chewed up by a conveyor or something. I notified Public Rec of the damage when I received the pants and filled out the return.  I also wrote it on the packing slip and you could see the damage on the plastic shipping bag. They accused me of ironing the pants and were going to send them back to me.  After much explanation and begging, they agreed to give me a refund.  Made me feel like I was stealing from them when all they had to do was file a claim with UPS. FYI pockets were not sewn correctly either. I have never experienced customer service being this poor.  Will never recommend or purchase again. They should take a customer service lesson with Nordstrom."
519,I keep adding another public rec item to my wardrobe every month.  Time to replace a T-shirt?order public rec. Time for new work pants? Order public rec. Have about every item by now in at least one color.
520,"Love Public Rec products, but recently had a disappointing experience with customer service. I mistakenly ordered the wrong version of pant. Ordered non-slim, was looking for slim. This was a final sale item. I was aware of the conditions regarding final sale (no returns) and was completely content with that condition. However, as I mentioned, I ordered the wrong pant. Long story short, the pants arrived, I quickly acknowledged that they were the wrong version and never tried them on/opened the bag. Contacted customer service both via call and email. Same response both times, ""Final sale, no returns"". I understand that this condition exists, but even with an order that has never even been opened? Not even a one time exception? For such a high premium we pay for their products, just was expecting a hint of leniency with their customer service."
521,I purchased a pair of ADED joggers and love them. I have had them for two months and have pushed them to the limits. I have used them to remove my materials from my classroom as I am a teacher. Had to travel up and down 3 flights of stairs and these joggers met challenge. They were comfortable and breathable. I received a few compliments as well. I have taken them on bike rides as well. I often pair my black joggers with a T-shirt and and white sneakers for a clean smart casual look. Took them camping for the weekend and they were glorious. The quality is well worth the price. The fit is spot on. I like my clothing more fitted and these def compliment my physique. I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù 205 semi-muscular with big thighs and they look phenomenal.
522,"After buying two pants and one shorts I discovered that to get a 42 waist size in a 36 length it‚Äôs not possible anymore. It‚Äôs ok to be a short fat guy, just not a tall one. Stupidest move you could make."
523,These all day pants are wonderful They look and feel great too.  Add a sport shirt and a vest...you will look great going out or on videoWith the Pandemic....I am living in these pants every day!!
524,"The All day everyday pant and work day pants are fantastic. ADED pants are the most comfortable and look fantastic with sneakers or dress up with loafers. Have all the colors and the workdays are sharp looking, super comfortable and can be worn for any occasion  equally as well. The long sleeve tees are fantastic! Wearing one now and the best fit and look to find. Bought the jacket and wear it constantly and totally great looking and compliments any look especially with these pants. I am a stylish picky fashionable guy and all of these cloths are something you are super comfortable but look really good all the time. Trust me you need to put these cloths on and you‚Äôll know what I speak. I‚Äôm always asked what I‚Äôm wearing too. Comfort in the go! :)"
525,"I bought one pair of Workday Pants and find the design, quality and comfort to be outstanding. We call them trousers over here, but these pants are so versatile, looking and feeling ideal for the office, for leisure and for traveling. The material is unique in that it is stretchy but doesn't bag around the knees despite being worn all day long and it is so nice not to wear jeans or chinos. The waistband is also well designed and sits very comfortably - not high waisted and not round the hips either - just perfect (for me!). The size of the garment was exactly correct and fits perfectly. I love the zipped rear pocket feature - so convenient and secure, and so well designed. No hesitation in giving WorkDay Pants 5 stars - I will order other colours"
526,"Public Rec clothing is among the most comfortable I've ever worn. I now have two pairs of ADED pants, two pairs of shorts and two hoodies. Order true to your preferred size and you'll love it."
527,"The pants are comfortable and looked good enough to wear to the office on a casual day. Unfortunately both side seams split just below the pockets. I paid to get them fixed, but they still look bad and are relegated to yard work.Yes, PublicRec did offer me $15 to have me repair the pant because they were outside the 45 day return period. They went on to say they don't have a warranty. Go figure. Here is their actual response:""As for the pants, our exchange policy covers unwashed and unworn garments within the 45-day return window. Upon review, this was already beyond the return window. We don't have a warranty for the pants, especially for those that were out of our return policy.""I guess you are on your own! They certainly will not own up to their quality problems."
528,"I purchased (2) of the ""All Day Everyday"" ADED pants:(1) All Day Every Jogger / Navy(1) All Day Every Pant / NavyAfter trying on both of the garments, I decided to immediately return the jogger straight away! After washing the ADED garment, I'm not impressed with this product at all! It came with wrinkles and the wrinkles remains after the wash! I wish to return the other ADEDP too!! Imo, they're nothing but a glorified pair of pajamas that's not even made in USA to boot! The Public Rec company should be ashamed of themselves asking $98 for this garment! IMO, I think this company should be called Public Rap‚Ç¨!The Public Rec company doesn't appear to have an active postal address. FYI.MePC * Maintaining and Being An Active Citizen Doing My Civic and Social Duties. ~ 2019"
529,"Hands down merchandise worth every penny! Have bought several items and exchanged a few along the way...seamless and painless. Garments fit great, wear and wash well...thx Public Rec!"
530,Great company. Great quality all day pants. Fast shipping. I bought multiples to try out the different sizes. Their return policy was easy. Highly recommend this company.
531,"Love the shorts I just purchased from Public Rec. They are very comfortable, just like the all day, every day pants. I will be looking to add the navy blue in the near future."
532,"Update: I just received a very apologetic email from the Company acknowledging the inappropriate handling of the issue and was given a refund.  This goes a long way.  Thank you.My son, who hates wearing anything but sweatpants, adores these pants and they are such a step of from sweatpants.  I would encourage anyone to consider them based on that.  Terrible customer service.  Ordered two pair of pants, sent one back within a week or so (end of October).  When I hadn't received my credit card refund, I emailed them today (beginning of December).  I was told that the pants were returned with food stains and they would be sending them back to me.  First, they were only tried on, so any stains happened in your warehouse upon return.  Second, really, it took you over a month to realize this?  I'm not buying it."
533,"Product is a cheap trouser not more worth than ‚Ç¨30,- also export to Europe you will have to pay ‚Ç¨35,- that makes this trouser over ‚Ç¨120! Not worth it. Shipping also takes 5 weeks"
534,Super satisfied with recent purchase of All day Every day pant. Very comfortable and look great. Only slight downside for me: a little baggier in the thighs than I prefer.
535,"I love all my clothing that I have purchased from Public Rec , so comfortable ! The shipping was fantastic!! Highly recommend, thank you for such a great product, Jerry"
536,As well as the toll charge and 4 week delivery the quality was not at all what I expected. The model was not as the photos but waist high ala grandfather 1940. Do not buy.
537,I discovered Public Rec on Facebook.  I order 2 pairs of the Workday Pant and loved them. Now have 6 pairs.  Work great for wearing to the office and the golf course.
538,My favorite brand for comfortable sharp looking clothes.  The only pants I can wear their clothes all day lounging in my house and at work.  Nothing else comopares.
539,"They are comfortable but they are sweat pants and they are cheaply done for the price, you can definitely get better quality, stitching, fabric etc.. for thier cost"
540,I ordered from this company two dresse on 6th December and have emailed them on numerous occasions no reply still haven‚Äôt had my order and no contact ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
541,"I bought my dad a pair of pants as a gift.  They fit him well, but the zipper was malfunctioning.  It would get stuck when you moved it.  I sent a note to customer service because I had planned on replacing them.  CS responded asking me to take a picture of the malfunctioning zipper (not something you can see).  I asked for a refund instead.  The same day I was making an exchange on Mack Weldon shorts for my husband (too small).  I went through a few steps and got a pop up saying that they didn't want me to have to wait for the replacement and that they would send the new pair out right away and that I needed to get the small ones in the mail within 30 days.  They made it so easy for me.  Asking someone to take a picture of an issue that you can't see.  I was just asking for a replacement. CS did not need to make this so hard hence the refund instead."
542,"Ordered just Prior to Christmas and arrived within 5 days. Pants are super comfortable, longer than expected so had them taken up and happy with the experience."
543,I can only add to the other poor reviews.I ordered the Pants online for delivery in the UK and at no stage does it mention having to pay for customs charges.The website quoted all costs in ¬£ with Shipping at ¬£5 and Customs and Duties at ¬£0.When they arrived I had to pay an additional ¬£22.50 customs charges to get the parcel released.I spoke to Public Rec and they just didn't want to know.Their Shipping info. weblink page just returns a blank screen and they have hidden the fact you have to pay customs charges in the FAQ page !This Customer Service just fobbed me off saying I should have taken the expedited DHL shipping service - which by the way mentions nothing about paying customs.Very Bad Customer Service.They hide the fact you have to pay an additional ¬£22 for customs duties to buy the Pants in the UK and really don't care about it when you complain it was not stated on the website order form.
544,I just received the workday pants and they seem very comfortable.  I have a pair of the lululemon and these seem just as comfortable and $30 cheaper.
545,"Decent product but horrible shipping and customer service. I made an exchange and week later they still have not shipped replacement. They say it is on its way but FedEx tracking shows that label was created but shipment has not been given to fedex. Expensive item but they ship cheap long and this time they are not shipping at all. Try Ministry of Supply, better product and customer service.IN RESPONSE to vendors comment: that is not what your rep told me, they tried to tell me that item was shipped and will arrive Saturday, which was clearly not true, they just did not want to deal with me. Here is response: Thanks for reaching out! Sorry to hear that you haven't received any update about the order. I'd be happy to assist.Saw this order was submitted on December 8th and the package was shipped the next day (December 9th). Upon checking this FedEx tracking number 781112367980, the estimated delivery date of the package is today, December 12th."
546,My son loved his every day pants Christmas gift! Says they‚Äôre the most comfortable pants ever! I love that they come in a 36 length as he is 6‚Äô7‚Äù!
547,"Bad quality. I bought a pair and after the first wash, the pocket completely detached. For this price, the quality should be much better."
548,Everyday pants are like wearing pajamas to work but definitely fulfilling the business casual dress code.  Super comfortable and no ironing!
549,I love this company. Both the ADED pant and Politan hoodie have totally transformed my comfort when flying. Totally recommend their products.
550,"I've hesitated in purchasing the All Day Every Day pants for quite some time as I was continually asking myself if they were worth the price. Been looking for some comfortable every day pants for quite some time. A few months ago I thought why not and ordered a pair to try them out I ordered from the mens section as I prefer more ""boyfriend"" style pants than the usual womens cut.  When the pants arrived I tried them on and they fit perfectly, good soft medium weight fabric that felt light to wear and looked very smart. They wash well too. These are the kind of pants I will wear practically everywhere as theyre so versatile and look just as smart as my usual ""smart"" pants, way more comfortable than jeans ... that i've pretty much given up on now....  and a step above trackpants.  I was so happy with the fit and quality of the first pair that I immediately ordered 3 more pairs and just now another 2 pairs in different colours.  Theyre not cheap but with the amount of wear Im going to give them they will represent good value."
551,I love this product. I wish I could have one of each style and color. Let‚Äôs hope they add more styles and colors - the more the merrier!
552,"Too hot and sweaty. Small pockets. Tight pocket opening,  so hard to do you know what. Tiny zipper  opening. Not worth it."
553,Public Rec is an absolutely wonderful company to work with.  Their clothing is great and their people are great.  It‚Äôs my go-to brand!
554,"Very Comfortable.I have ordered several Items and all have a great fit and feel. The clothes ""breath"" and the material feels great."
555,"A friend of mine recommended that I try Public Rec Apparel for men.  This was over a year ago and I have since purchased multiple pairs of pants shorts and tops.  At first I wasn‚Äôt sure what all the hype was about, a Public Rec is a bit more pricey until I tried on a pair of the pants and realized how absolutely comfortable are, and the true test of fine apparel for men is how well they fit, feel and washes and wears.  I am pleased to say that all of the apparel is so comfortable fits nicely and washes beautifully in cold water or warm water with light tumble dry and there‚Äôs no shrinkage.  Additionally, all the colors ‚Äústay fast‚Äù meaning they do not fade.  I would recommend Public Rec to any guy that‚Äôs looking for really comfortable high-quality casual apparel.  Lastly, I would suggest you buy tops a ‚Äúsize up‚Äù as the stretch / cotton fabric is a bit more form fitting and I personally like apparel  that is a bit more loose fitting!  Keep it coming Public Rec!  More fresh casual styles would be appreciated."
556,"Very comfortable and great looking pants. I own a pair of joggers,5 pairs of ADED and 2 pairs of workday pants. They‚Äôre all great."
557,I have 7 public rec items. The fabrics are unique (very stretchy) and comfortable. They seem to be well made and I like the fit.
558,"Bought the ADED pants - the sizing is just right and the cut is very good, although the pants are a bit more synthetic looking than I'd hoped. I live in the UK and paid for international shipping. Unfortunately there was an additional customs charge and UK delivery surcharge to pay in order to receive the item. FAQs does mention the possibility of local taxes etc on international orders, but not additional delivery fee. Having bought from other US companies for international shipping it is possible to pay all costs at point of sale and Public Rec aim to offer this in future. I contacted customer service and they were great, no complaints there at all - hence 3 stars for this review instead of 2. However, overall given the additional costs and slow shipping, my experience has been poor and not good value for money - I doubt I'd buy from Public Rec again. If you're buying from overseas for international shipping think carefully - the price you think you're paying and the amount you end up paying may not be the same."
559,Love the clothes the shorts and polo combos are slick and comfortable! I‚Äôve already placed my next order and I am excited!
560,"The model ADEFD is the best pants I have. I was ""addicted"" to jeans, but I moved to these pants after having tried them."
561,"Placed an order with Public Rec on 5/18/2022, credit card was charged same day.  5/19 to 5/22 received emails from Public Rec about order, label creation, shipping, and expected delivery date. (5/22/2022).  Notified that package was delivered on 5/22/2022 - yet no package was delivered.  Contacted Public Rec, they asked me to check to see if my neighbors got my package - I checked and my neighbors haven't received the package.  Public Rec then asked me to wait for 48-72 hours - maybe the package would show up, and they they would investigate from their end.May 24th - Checked back with Public Rec was told that there was no info based on their investigation. May 25th checked back on status and was told to wait for another 48-72 hours.May 25 to 6/1. No info or packages received from Public Rec.It is now 240+ hours since the 'delivery' was made and they only needed 48-72 hours.There is a total of 11 email exchanges - all were polite, all from different people and all with virtually no plan of action.  Was told to wait some more.The ONLY thing I got from Public Rec was a charge on my credit card and worthless emails.IF Public Rec has a customer service moral compass it must be pointed to where the sun does not shine.I do not like writing bad reviews - but this is ridiculous, and hopefully others won't make the same mistake I did of trying to deal with this company."
562,"I purchased 3 pair of workday pants. When I first got them I loved them. Color and fabric was nice and they were very comfortable. However after 3 months things have changed. I wash them on delicate and hang dry. They have never been in a dryer. i wear them to work (office job) only. I started to notice on the khaki pair on the front thigh area they started to pic and look very worn. I have 3 colors so I wear the khaki more often. Well I contacted there customer service and the responded quickly. The main reason was to send them pics of the issue and see if they are having this happen a lot. Given I paid $108 per pair I expected a high quality product that would withstand more wear than I have given them. The response was kind of like they thought I was stupid. I mean they acted like I didn‚Äôt know how to wash and care for fine clothing. So I sent them pictures to see if this was something that was a isolated case. The response was disappointing. It was like .. that‚Äôs wear and tear and I must be abusing the garment. Not the response I was looking for, they really didn‚Äôt seem like they cared."
563,"Order, pay, shipped and received all as business should be handled. All things timely and in exactly as represented."
564,The worst customer service on the planet Very deceptive Absolutely the worst company everThey stole my money
565,Best pants ever i am from the caribbean and its hot. I feel good in these pants.also great customer service.
566,Comfortable fit. Quality material. Quick delivery & excellent customer service. Highly recommend these pants
567,"Great shorts, the material and cut make them super comfy..  Highly recommend! Awesome customer service too!"
568,Product is everything advertised. Size and fabric are perfect. Third product purchased from this company
569,"Just send me a return label that I can take to FedX, UPS or USPS order number is 332001 zip is 60491"
570,"I love the fit, the high quality of material (even the zippers!) and the soft feel.  My go-to now..."
571,These everyday pants are the greatest pants in the world. Super soft plus the sizing feels custom made
572,Public Rec never fails to deliver a great product and equally good customer service.
573,"I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but i just got my ‚Äúall day every day joggers‚Äù in the mail from public rec and I just gotta give props where props are due. First, public rec‚Äôs customer service helped me a lot. I‚Äôm extremely picky when it comes to online shopping so I had a million questions about fit. The gentleman I dealt with was incredibly helpful and patient. The joggers themselves are an absolute home run! Couple things: the fabric is fantastic, Super soft but also very durable, There‚Äôs a zipper in one of the pockets which is great for keys and money so the important stuff doesn‚Äôt slide out, there‚Äôs also a little pouch in one of the pockets that is good for gripping a phone. The pants also just fit really nicely. Very few companies offer a waist size and a length. (I‚Äôm a 32/30) It‚Äôs a huge upgrade from the standard s,m,l you normally see joggers come in. The pants are a little on the pricey side but given the fit and the quality I really do think they‚Äôre worth it. These things seem like they‚Äôre gonna last forever so I feel its money well spent. If I had to compare these to something I‚Äôd say they are a better version of the lululemon joggers. If you‚Äôre looking for pants to workout in or chill around the house these are what you want."
574,Love their clothing. Fabrics are great. Very comfortable with good fit. Highly recommend them.
575,"This company is an absolute scam.  If you look at their website, it is full of reviews that rant and rave about how great they are.  When trying to leave a review on that site, it is quickly deleted and taken down.  Showing their ethics there is just the start.  I purchased two pair of 100 dollar pants.  The first wearing of one of them, the stitching down the side came undone and left me with a 2 inch hole below the pocket.  The second pair, after the first washing, started bunching up and the fabric felt completely different than before the wash.  When I tried to get resolution from the company, what I received instead was a lecture on how to properly wash their pants and also a request for photo proof of the stitching so that they could determine what actions they wanted to take.  Seriously???  Most every high-end retailer I have EVER dealt with has a no-questions return or replacement policy.  It is built into the cost of the product and having a superior product would greatly reduce these types of problems.  Now that we are in the real world, the true review number surfaces.  Save your money and DO NOT buy this product.  As a positive, now have a couple pair of pants I can use when my wife asks me to paint something or change oil or go to Wal Mart."
576,"I have a number of pants, tees and hoodies. The all wear well, feel great and look terrific."
577,Terrible after sales service. They treat you like trash once you handed over your money.
578,Nice pants. Got them as a gift for my guy. He loves it. Exactly how they describe it.
579,Just look at all the ONE star reviews and make your own judgement about this company.
580,"So comfortable,washes well,fits well in all the right places. Highly recommended."
581,"Excellent company and great clothing! Recommend the all day every pants, luxury!"
582,"I now own 4 pairs of the Workday pants, 2 pairs of the ADED pants, and 1 pair of the ADED shorts. I STILL notice every time I put them on how comfortable and attractive they are - particularly the Workday pants which I do indeed wear to work in a semi-formal office environment.The material on the Workday pants has a stretch that makes movement and sitting really comfortable, and the cuffs at the ankle STAY PUT instead of bunching up or pulling upward on the calf like other pants do. They don't lose any color or material quality no matter how often I wash them. And now I also wear them out for casual stuff because they look and feel better than all my other pants.The ADED pants are nice enough to wear while out doing things, but I especially love using them as really nice ""lounging pants"" at night when I'm at home. They'd even be great pajama pants if people wanted to use them that way.I've worn the shorts to the gym, but honestly I think now I'll just save them for days when I'm out and about - they have a really nice look and I think I'm wasting that at the gym a little. And I don't want them to get beat up in there.The price of the clothing made me nervous at first, so I started with just one pair of pants after some careful research. It's been completely worth it, so I've rebuilt a lot of my wardrobe around this stuff. I get compliments A LOT. They're an intelligent investment."
583,"Not reliable. Payed the bill, got no shipment. Waiting since weeks.Attention!"
584,"A rewards program provides benefits based on your purchases (for ex., points usable in future purchases). Their ""Member Rewards"" is more akin to a club, like Sam's Club or CostCo, where you pay an annual fee to become a member for a year. Except KingSize's Member Rewards charges $14.99 MONTHLY. Unless you're buying enough for your shipping and codes to offset $180 a year, it's not worth it. In my case, where I haven't bought clothes from them from over a year, that's money down the drain.And that's just the beginning; the amount of catalogs they send me and my wife for their multiple brands is a small forest-worth of paper. Trying to stay top-of-mind with their marketing sure is expensive in terms of our environment."
585,"I've tried several times to collect my rewards and or apply ""afterward"" for my free shipping privileges without success because your company has made a process, that with other companies is so simple, ridiculous and seemingly purposely overcomplicated so that people give up. Why not have the ""supposed"" free shipping kick in automatically? Stop making people jump through hoops, it makes you all look like thieves."
586,They did the same thing too me again saying I have multiple accounts when I question them there response was I had had 3 accounts this year.  Well yes I have because you keep canceling them saying I have multiple then . Say oh no you don't and I have to open a new one. Plus my card did get hacked and since it has to go through a card and not a account  you have to cancel your account and start over because they can't change your payment method.   They need to get there act together
587,Please be aware that this company might slip that $14.95 charge on your account without your authorization or if they get that authorization it is through a deceptive practice. I will never purchase another item from this company. They then told me that all major retailers have similar programs but I don't get similar charges. It may not be theft or fraud but it is so very close.
588,"I noticed 5 months of $14.95 charges on my credit card from King Size Rewards, went to opt out, there website says log in to account, them from account drop down says go to cancel membership, no such option anywhere on the website! Terrible practice, never authorized them to charge me every month regardless of they will tell you! Be very cautious when placing any order!"
589,I just found out this company has been charging me subscription fees for the last year when I never signed up with them.I went through their site its just a bunch of hidden text when u buy something. then the make a account for you without you knowing u dont even pick ur own user or pass. then they e-mail you the details. so when ur u-mail labels them as a spam you never even see the e-mail.Unless i get my money back im going to dedicate the next few months of my life to ensuring i report this company to every possible place possible
590,"CrooksI received a bill for $14.95 to my credit card after a purchase. Customer Service stated I agreed to the rewards program. I did not! Signup is hidden or so fine that customers miss it and get billed. They even billed my credit card that I did not have on file. They stole it from my purchase information. Customer Service did refund my $14.95 and removed me from their ""rewards program"". They still secretly have my credit card information.Shady business practice."
591,It‚Äôs a great program as someone like myself who shops at the site a lot it‚Äôs nice for them to reward and show they appreciate their customer with the program. Only issues I have is the fact when you order something you have to submit the information vs it picking up from the site automatically. Also I don‚Äôt really like that we have to pay for it each month. But really appreciate the site it‚Äôs saved my life a bunch of time :)
592,"Scam.   A $15 monthly fee for a ""Rewards"" program is absurd.  Let alone for one where you must submit individual claims for your ""Rewards"".The fees are mentioned at the end of the details in small type, I consider this to be a dishonest business practice.When i asked King Size Direct (KSD) about this issue, they claim that the rewards program is run by a different company and it was out of their hands.I am terminating any business with King Sized Direct.  So hopefully they'll enjoy that 15 bucks.  It's the last they'll get from me."
593,"99 times out of 100 and i have ordered over 100 items, the items i have ordered are spot on. If you still buy those crappy pants from dockers or the ""other"" place that tear constantly, you are crazy. I still wear pants to work that i bought 7 years ago. They get washed every week. Color has faded a bit, but they are still dependable and have not torn or worn in the crotch area. Finally, good dependable clothes that last for us big guys."
594,"I never signed up for this, and was hit for $14.95/month. You should be ashamed of the way you do business. You are no different than a pick pocket on the street, you bunch of crooks. I will never spend another penny with your companies and will share with everyone I can about what a scam this is. Shame on you!"
595,"This is fraud. I did not know there was a fee involved which is automatically deducted every month. I don‚Äôt recall agreeing to this: it must be deceptively worded with the intent to SCAM. I have been a long-standing customer, but will no longer be shopping with this company."
596,"This ""rewards"" service is a complete SCAM.They sign you up with promises of ""savings"", and then the proceed to charge you $16 month.When you call the King Size company, they play dumb and insist that King Size Rewards is a completely different company.SCAM. FRAUD. DISHONEST.This should be shut down!"
597,"I never received the initial credit...that I know of.  Hard to get a hold of these people.   I am not sure what I am getting for the $16 that I have been charged since January.   Did receive a $5 credit this month.  Cancel it, it seems to be a con.Update.  14min later.  As you can see they replied by not trying to address my concerns (initial credit, program details, contact info) , but saying they would be happy to cancel me.  Of course, they have taken several months of fees first."
598,"I will never order from this place again. I love the product I received; however, like so many others on here, I was scammed with a monthly $15 credit card charge for their rewards program that I didn‚Äôt authorize. This place is straight up FRAUD!"
599,Never saw this came with a fee. Looks like you got a free $16 out of my PayPal. I‚Äôll dispute it and contact the BBB. Your pop up said sign up for rewards and get free shipping. Maybe explain that comes with a monthly charge. I won‚Äôt ever use your service again. Ordered 2 times from your company and you managed to mess them both up. One was for 2 pairs of sweatpants (sent the wrong size but I kept them anyways because they are sweat pants who cares) and one was a 4 pack of boxers and every pair of boxers was a different size (how the hell did you manage that?). Combine that with your dreadfully slow shipping that costs too much money and your terrible email support and you lost a customer for life.
600,"First, I cannot find access to the check my rewards balance. Second, rewards expire too quickly to be used. Third, no one responds to emails or other correspondence. Fourth, I would like to cancel since I have to pay for it"
601,"I received a fraudulent charge of $14.95 from FBB*KINGSIZE REWA in my bank statement 4 months after I purchased a few belts from KingSize.com. This is absolutely shameful and despicable that they would trick people into signing up for something they had no idea what for, especially 4 months later! This could've gone unnoticed for months if I hadn't checked my statement tonight when it went through. UPDATE 02/08/2022: I am now also seeing charges that go all the way back to November of last year. This is absolutely reprehensible predatory behavior.I will be filing a report with the Attorney General, a Consumer Fraud Report with the Department of Justice, the FTC, and filing a Consumer Complaint with the Better Business Bureau. This is predatory business practices!This is NOT okay!DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!"
602,"I absolutely LOVE Kingsize Tee shirts. They fit extremely well and are durable. So when I received an offer to purchase three of these incredible men's shirts at $10.00 each I naturally jumped on it. Well, found out I could not order them online. Got on the live chat with a Kingsize customer service rep and was promptly informed I would need to call a special number so I did. The rep who answered the call was very pleasant and personable and yes, I was able to purchase the three shirts at the advertised price. The trouble was, after providing all of the information required I was then informed I would need to purchase an additional shirt at a price of $21.00. This brought my total purchase to $70.00. I was using my wife's bank card to make this purchase and yes, I had her permission but she hit the roof when she found out what it cost us. I think these are unfair and deliberate targeting of people attempting to take advantage of an advertised bargain and is highly unethical. I cannot say if it was the rep or if this is company policy but in either case, much as I love their shirts, I will buy elsewhere from now on."
603,"The amount in an email was $10 more. I don't trust your math at all. Also, I am in good standing and not able to use credit. No idea why, no communication."
604,Have ordered three items from camp saver - one was delivered and was not all dented up - and two more of the same item are on the way - considering that I returned two titanium cups to the large box store for a refund because they had been dented - I found it surprising that campsaver would send out the titanium cups from them with no box - just a cup floating around in a plastic mailer with no protection - which is fine if nothing happens to it but all it takes is one incident along the delivery chain and then you would have a hassle to return it and blah blah blah - other than that - things are okay.     update: received the other two cups this time they were packaged in cardboard and looked new - however one had what looked like an old price label ripped off the information wrap around the outside of the cup and the other had no outside information wrap at all - so inventory must be low - besides sharing that information I have no complaints about product and condition of all three cups I ordered and received from campsaver.
605,"They let me order shoes that aren‚Äôt  in stock without telling ahead.Thank god I needed the shoes to arrive in a specific time. that made me check with their mail service about the arrival of the shipment, then realised they even dont have the shoes and they are waiting for them to get back in stock so they would  ship them to me - in three months from my date of order.It‚Äôs written 8-10 business days the day I order."
606,"I ordered a smoker, and 14 days later, the order was ""still processing."" I contacted customer sercive twice and received 2 different stories about why the smoker was delayed. I was promised a shipping confirmation next day, and I never got it"
607,"Camp saver completely dropped the ball with my last purchase. I ordered several items, 1 that was on backorder. An email said the backordered item wouldn't be available until the next month. Fine, I can deal with that. Two weeks go by and there's no word about the items that weren't on backorder. I wrote to customer service and they kept telling me the one item was on backorder but didn't mention the others. This went on until the backordered item was finally available almost A MONTH after I ordered and everything was shipped.I contacted them again to see why everything else wasn't shipped while waiting for the backordered item. Their excuse: To keep shipping free, we try to do it all together. Yet, the backordered item was shipped an entirely different method than the rest of the stuff. That means they could have shipped everything else MUCH earlier and then the last item when it arrived. I bought everything for a camping trip and thanks to how long they took shipping everything, I wasn't able to take it along."
608,"I placed an order on a Saturday for an item I really, really needed for a once-in-a-lifetime trip. This was after Amazon messed it up. Their ""risk management"" department came back with a handful of intrusive and ridiculous questions about the item's purpose, end user, and final destination. Okay, I thought, I'll play your stupid game because I have no choice. My clock is ticking. It then sat there for FIVE DAYS while I practically begged them to release it. Nope. I wound up canceling, and now I don't have this thing I counted on having. They don't care even a little. Heed the horrible reviews and don't shop here."
609,"Campsaver.com customer service is outstanding!  Vickie was very helpful, friendly, professional, and efficient.  She cheerfully stood behind the company's price matching guarantee and refunded me the difference between the sale price and original price that I paid for the boots that I purchased.  I will definitely order from campsaver.com again."
610,"I am purchasing at CS for years and I have never faced any problems with them. Same about the returns and refunds. The only complaint could be my feeling that they seem to postpone the free shippment to make you purchase the express one.I tested the return after about 1/2 a year too. No problem,  I received the shop credit at the day the merchadise was delivered."
611,"Their inventory and shipping times are fanciful dreams. I've ordered from CampSaver many times hoping it'd be different, believing the excuses they give me, and I've finally decided to just give up and know that, well, they're just that: excuses for a poorly run business with a horrible logistics operation that hides behind small text, disclaimers, and plays fast and loose with facts & math.The crux of it is this: if you say you can ship something on time, in a given time frame, and especially if I pay extra for a given level of service, I expect that kind of service. Not in an unreasonable way, I know things aren't perfect (esp in a pandemic/post-pandemic world where labor and other items are still recovering), but every time I order from CampSaver, they never ship on time, and it takes so long I have to call to cancel (and you can't cancel it online despite them saying you can... if you can, I've never been given the option), and when it happens consistently (every time) the excuses about ""longer than normal warehouse times"" or ""product availability wasn't properly updating on our website, sorry, just a one time bug"" or similar become really patronizing and just aren't believable, they're either lying or so poorly run these issues are systemic, constant, and they should just not make any commitments. Neither reason is good at all! Sure, they cancel the order and I get my refund eventually (thus not only one star, that's reserved for outright scams...), but this isn't much better. It feels like they take your order HOPING they have inventory (even if they say they have it, I have waited up to 10 business days for it to ship before I just gave up) and if they have it and their warehouse can get it together to put it in a box and send it, they ship it, I guess, but otherwise, they just hold on to your money until you ask for it back.Their prices aren't much better than Backcountry, REI, Moosejaw, etc, but their warehousing & logistics operations are absolutely a disaster."
612,"Gross overcharge for a 1-3 day delivery service ($165USD). When checking their USPS tracking details - they actually used a lower delivery method of 3-5 Days which equals around $65~ for the package I was being delivered. When pulling them up on the sneaky overcharge, they refused to refund the difference. Lack of respect & obviously trying to make a profit at their customers expense."
613,"I purchased a Sierra Designs Flex Capacitor 40-60L backpack from Campsaver.com, and I had a rewarding experience. I placed my order on a Wednesday and received the backpack the following Tuesday. I was extremely pleased with the fast processing and shipping. Better yet, the customer service was terrific. The reps I spoke with were helpful, professional and friendly, and they were not pushy at all. I highly recommend Campsaver.com."
614,"One of the top 3 worst shopping experiences ever, not worth even one star. Placed order and paid when there were a couple dozens of items in stock, 4 days later I hear back saying my order was cancelled because the product is not available."
615,"Ordered a pair of climbing shoes, but they turned out to be a tad too big.  No prob, shipped back to Campsaver on their own dime.  Got another pair and too small.  You guessed it, sent back again at their cost.  Received pair #3 (again at campsaver.com's cost) and they are perfect!  So easy to deal with, great prices, and exceptional return/exchange policies.  One really can't ask for more."
616,I had terrific customer service. Ordered last weekend. My order arrived today (total 6 days). I think people who commented in recent months didn't take into account the problem with the USPS. I saved $73 per pair of shoes which is substantial. There was a glitch with the website so I ended up ordering over the phone and the people at Campsaver couldn't have been nicer.
617,I ordered an item December 1 for a Christmas present and to date it has only ever shown as in process. That's 17 days so far without any progress and I have called customer service every day this week. They only tell me that they have tried escalating my order assuring me that it is not a back order issue they are simply that back logged. I will never do business with this company again.
618,"I ordered a tent in august and it had not yet delivered.  They keep moving the delivery date and when I contacted them, they said""you can cancel the order at anytime""....  an incredible disrespectful approach to doing business...  I won't cancel my order and I am waiting to see how long it will take for them to deliver my purchase. So far almost 5 months.  My order number is Order #16175318"
619,"Trash Company, avoid like the plague. Ordered a bike box with express shipping (~$290 + $60 shipping), 8 working days later and they are still ""processing"" the order. If you can't fulfill customer orders, don't accept payment for so many...there are plenty of competitors out there who will do a much better job & happily take the business you are clearly unable to handle."
620,"Placed an order which was shipped via UPS - order was over $1600.00.  Received a confirmation that it was delivered, though it never was.  Campsaver would NOT return emails, so I disputed the charge with my credit card.  Two months later, it arrives.  Campsaver instantly contacted me for their money.  Communication is terrible, order process was terrible.  I would NEVER place an order with this company again."
621,"Do not buy from campsaver.com.   They sent me the wrong item, twice, and I only ordered one item.  If I had to wait for a backorder, it would be another 2 months before I seen the item I ordered, and camping season will be over by then.  I should charge them interest for holding onto my money.  Fortunately for them, the lowest rating I can give them is one star, they actually deserve a negative 5 star review."
622,"This was not a good experience.  I made a large several item order.   No acknowledgement.  Three weeks later, I received one item that was marked irregular.  When I eventually got a hold of customer service, which was in and of itself a challenge, they said they would precess a return, but I have heard nothing.  Camp savers is not a legit site.  Beware."
623,"The site promises a 5-10 day delivery window. It has been 1 Month and still no delivery or communication regarding the delay. Speaking of communication, Campsaver communication is horrible. It is next to impossible to get up with them because when you call an automatic response tells you that ""they are not currently taking calls..."" and when you e-mail you get no response."
624,"Customer service is horrible. They do not answer their  phones and took 3 days to get back to me through e-mail. I ordered $450 worth of hiking boots and paid expedited shipping. Unfortunately, they did not inform that a pair was on backorder when we placed the order. We found out a week later on the eve of our hiking weekend.  There is no excuse for poor customer service! Will never purchase from them again."
625,"Good prices, but slow shipping, poor customer service, and your backordered item (which a lot are on campsaver...) will hold up your entire order for months only for them to tell you (once you've complained it hasn't been shipped AND you haven't even heard a word about it) it's no longer available and the other things will finally be shipped.. stick with rei, backcountry, enwild and the other good outdoorsy stores. Campsaver sucks."
626,Ordererd on December 13 and still hadn't received my order by the 23rd. Looked through my spam folder and found a request to verify the billing on the order by having to chase down a small charge on my credit card statement and call them back with the secret number. I try to call this morning and they're closed for the holiday. Not sure if this order will ever ship. That's a crazy way to do business in the age of Amazon. I guess another dinosaur of e-commerce will bite the dust soon...
627,"I saw the 2+ star reviews but I took a chance because it was almost 40 bucks cheaper to buy my hiking boots here compared to REI. This is my first purchase (so can't speak to how it would be if things had gone wrong) and it went incredibly smooth and fast. Got exactly what I paid for. I'm a happy camper (and hiker), quite literally."
628,"I read the reviews and initially was very concerned after ordering from CampSaver. I am happy to say that the products arrived in a very reasonable time with no issues.  The prices and color choices were excellent on some difficult to find OR hoodies.  I have not had to deal with customer service, but my order was managed well, shipped expediently and the product good. No issues for me!"
629,"Please don‚Äôt be fool on this website thinking you can save. I ordered an item, put the right shipping address, confirmation email showed a wrong name where it ship to. No option to cancel the purchase even if you just put it a second ago. Contacted support and they told me it has already been shipped and ai have to pay $16.40 to have UPS return it. Ridiculous!!!"
630,"I ordered a sleeping pad from CampSaver that was just a few dollars cheaper than anywhere else then came here and saw all of these reviews which got me really freaked out and nervous. Sure enough, however, my package arrived on time with the free 2-day shipping promotion that was on their site and the product is perfect! Not to discredit any of the previous reviews but I wanted to say that my experience was great!"
631,"I've placed a couple of big orders with Campsaver over the years; they have a good range and competitive prices.  As I'm an overseas customer, I occasionally get snagged by the export restrictions on certain brands and products which isn't made clear until after the order (and payment) go through, but that's not so much Campsaver's issue as international trade restrictions. Will definitely continue to shop here."
632,I ordered a climbing gear package for my son and when it arrived I gave him the box for him to open. I later saw the gear package that came was a substantially cheaper package than the one purchased. I emailed them and customer service said it could only be returned with tags still attached but my son had already opened everything up.  Definitely will not be buying from them again or OpticsPlanet because I'm pretty sure they're the same.
633,"My first experience with this business was perfect.  The money I saved on a coat I've been hunting for for several weeks is huge.  Shipping was fast, coat new and perfect.  The money I saved was significant as my coat is still being sold by the manufacturer.  This place won me over.  This will be my goto place to look first."
634,"Bought a pair of boots that they said were in stock because other vendors were sold out of my size. After they credited my card, they sent me an email saying it was not in stock and wouldn't ship for 16-30 days. After waiting 30 days, they sent me an email saying they cancelled my order all together because of stocking issues. Absolutely horrific way to run an online retail store and in would not trust them with another purchase."
635,"After reading the reviews of CampSaver on many sites, I was hesitant about placing an order from them. However, my experience was completely positive. I placed an order for an item last Saturday, it shipped out on Sunday with tracking information, and it arrived today (Thursday). The item was well-packaged and as described. I'd order from them again!"
636,"Someone made a $305 purchase with my credit card #. Have tried to contact. Phone # leads to no one, not answering the phone due to covid and directs to their contact by email info. All contact email info leads to 402 Gateway timed out page. Should answer any doubt's about this company. STAY AWAY, GO ELSEWHERE!!!!"
637,"I have chosen ""order cancel"" twice 10 mins after purchased the shoes last night.  But today the order status is ""order shipped"".  I tried to send them email but their no idea why thier email system just pop up ""error"".I'm a long term customer of CS for years,  but today I have found that the canceling order system is a mess.  They should learn it from Taobao,  fast and efficient.  After today expericence,  I think I will no longer buy things on CS, I will buy somewhere else like Amazon."
638,I placed an order for two shirts. They tell me one wasn‚Äôt really in stock‚Ä¶ I ordered two shirts identical because they were for twins. They decided to just ship me one without Asking whether I wanted the rest of the order. I‚Äôm not even on their subscription list and they send me ads every single day
639,"After waiting almost 8 weeks and several calls which was communicated to me my order would be filled on 3 different dates, and my order still had not been filled. I was told on the second call that they would upgrade my shipping. I did find the item through another vendor which offered the same discounts and shipping but was also able to use my dividend for more cost savings. The quickest response I received was cancelling the order."
640,"Order a tent and wait for two weeks yet not getting the tracking code or shipment update. When I contact their CSAfter the first week, they told me the ordered already shipped, but when I contact again in the second week, they told me the order just being processed and ask me to wait couple more day for the tracking code."
641,"On entering the website, I get an offer for 10% off on my next order (no * anywhere with fine print),  if I sign up for their emails.  So I sign up and get a code which I plug in to use on my order.  Then it says code is no good, so I try it a few more times.  Finally I get to a page that shows all the things that the discount doesn't apply to.  Now, hopefully, I can unsubscribe to their emails and shop elsewhere."
642,"I posted this exact thing on yelp: I can't help but feel compelled to write a review. I was pretty distraught after I placed my order and then stumbled across the substantially less than flattering reviews. Before I became aware of those reviews, I ordered an air mattress which was the best deal I could find even though it was just a few bucks. They shipped it that day and it arrived shortly thereafter on time and as expected. I had a pretty good experience. No worries at all."
643,"This company is terrible. Everything is 'in stock' until you order it, and then two weeks later they tell you it's not in stock and it will ship to you in a month or two. When questioned they said they are a small company which makes it difficult to track inventory??Zero customer service, no refunds for returns (and everything is manual, no online return request). Had to file a claim with my bank for a returned item. Just the worst shopping experience. And apparently, a scam."
644,"Ordered my gear and they told me it would be around 20 days to fill the order. That's fine, everything was from Japan. 1 month later they still don't have it. 2 months later they still don't have it, and tell me it is going to be another month. 3 months (maybe longer) just to get stock of the items I ordered. Don't waste your time."
645,"Winning!I purchased my tent about 4 weeks ago. I got a great price and it was delivered promptly with no issues. I had a question about pricing and the customer service rep was the nicest I have ever dealt with. Very friendly, funny and accommodating.I just ordered my backpack from them today and, again, got a great price. So far, they have exceeded my expectations. I had purchased mainly from REI in the past, which is also a great site. Campsaver beats them in pricing and service (so far), IMO."
646,"I placed an order with CampSaver.com despite the many negative reviews on Trustpilot because they offered the best deal on the coat I wanted. I ordered it on Saturday, it shipped Monday, and was delivered the following Monday via free ""value"" shipping from Utah to Pennsylvania. I was worried that the coat would be second-quality because it was so cheap, but it arrived in perfect condition. While I absolutely believe the other reviewers who had bad experiences, I wanted to share my positive experience as well."
647,"I‚Äôve been an REI member for decades. Not to minimize the force that is REI, but, as I recently am rebuilding my backpacking equipment after decades of child and now grandchild-rearing, I have searched for competitive deals across the web. CampSaver has universally been helpful in recommendations via phone and email (I‚Äôm rural) and I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchases. I think they‚Äôre amused by the grandmother desiring to return to the mountains (okay, with my knees, the hills). Dreams keep us alive."
648,I have ordered several products from stuff sacks to sleeping bags to camping mats over the past year from Campsaver. They consistently offers the lowest prices (especially if you can locate a coupon code). I live in Colorado (right next to their headquarters in Utah) so I always get their products fast. I plan to do business with them again.
649,"They shipped me the wrong item, and after reading everyone else's review it was probably intentional. I'm guessing that the email I will ""eventually"" receive will state the item is on backorder. I should have done my research before purchasing from this sham co. DO NOT BUY FROM CAMPSAVER."
650,"Customer service ignored my email request for expedited shipping for an order placed over the weekend that didn't get shipped on Monday, despite the claim on their website, which is the main reason I purchased from them.  Then I was laughed at, told to have a nice day, then hung up on when calling today inquiring about expediting my shipping, even offering to pay the difference.  Worst first experience with an online retailer in an otherwise consumer friendly industry.  Ruined my day."
651,"DO YOUR SELF FAVOR BUY FROM ANY OTHER STORE WITH GOOD REVIEW, NOT THIS STORE,I ORDERED  ALMOST 1 WEEK AGO & I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM ,NO LUCK ,FOR SURE PHONE LINE IS BUSY & THEY NEVER ANSWER ,EMAIL GOOD LUCK THEY NEVER ANSWER ILL CANCEL MY ORDER FROM MY BANK ,WORST ONLINE EXPERIENCE EVER ."
652,"I ordered a zero helix chair and was so happy with the service, delivery, and quality of the product and experience. The site was easy to use, I received the product within a week time period, and the product was great! Couldn't say more good things about this experience and I will definitely order from campsaver again!"
653,"As the title states, they mailed me the men's parka. There was supposedly only one women's parka left in stock so I can only assume that they never had one. Irritating, especially since I am in US for only a few weeks and now won't have time to buy the jacket elsewhere.I had read these reviews before ordering but decided to take a chance since they were so much cheaper than everywhere else.The positive was that they were very nice on the phone and set up a return, no problem."
654,"I found out about Campsaver on a deal site after years of using Backcountry and Gear Express.  They appeared to have the cheapest pricing and offered a 10% off coupon if I signed up for mailing list.  Well I did, only to find out it doesn't work for sale items or a wealth of various brands.  Nowhere on the sign up page did it state this and it made me cancel my purchase.  How is giving a $4.80 one-time discount not worth acquiring a guaranteed repeat customer?  Foolish business practice."
655,"Great experience. I bough a tee and a jacket that was on sale and had a great experience. Received the products on the estimated time, both the products were right, and I am amazed with the quality of the jacket (it is a DEMO) but you cannot really tell the difference of the one I got and a new one. Have 0 problems with CampSaver. Will definitely buy some more stuff. Looking at all bad reviews I don‚Äôt know if I got lucky or what... but everything went just perfect. Best price for the jacket and I dig down the online stores."
656,"I have had positive experiences with CampSaver, having purchased 2 high-end down coats, each costing several hundred dollars, and priced significantly lower than other retailers. Each brand, one of which is Canada-based and the other based in Sweden, is sold by just a couple of other retailers in the US, so, availability plus great prices, and, no shipping fees, was a no-brainer for me. They shipped out each coat the next day and they arrived about a week later. I would not hesitate to buy from CampSaver, again."
657,"I ordered a Big Agnes Rattlesnake 2 tent with the mountainGlo lights (footprint, included free; free shipping, discounts, and extra discounts).  I got a tremendously good deal; so good, I was just hoping I would actually receive the tent....and, I did!  CampSaver made me a very satisfied, happy customer.üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ"
658,"I have bought several items from CampSaver and I have been thrilled with the quality of each purchase.   When I have bought a clothing/shoe item, if the size didn't fit when I received it, no problem, they quickly and easily exchanged it for me. I will continue to make CampSaver my first stop for all of my outdoor needs!"
659,"These people absolutely do not want or care about your money. When I went into the distribution store in Cache Valley, I was going to get a product from the warehouse that they had in stock, I knew what I wanted, however when I went in, the guy at the counter was so put out that I came in 10 minutes prior to closure he made an effort to be so ignorant to my needs I just decided to turn around and leave.  They must make too much money that they don‚Äôt need mine, I will not ever purchase from them again."
660,"I've been waiting for 12+ business days (since my return was delivered to them) to receive my refund. No communication from Campsaver. When I called, they told me that returns are backed up and they may get to it next week. First order with them and sure to be my last. Stick to Backcountry or REI."
661,I ordered something out of stock (because of a coupon they had). It was supposed to be delivered in 3 to 4 weeks and I wanted to save some $$$. A month goes by and I hear nothing from them. I email them and they said the item won't be in stock for a month. It shouldn't take 2 months to get an item from a major brand. It's not like a backpack is a rare and hard to acquire item. If there is going to be a huge delay they should communicate that to the customer. This seems like a no brainer in today's world.
662,"i ordered a jacket from their website to get here (in Australia) for winter. 1 month later the product still hadnt been dispatched. The delivery component of the order was US$57.80, and was promised to arrive within 14-25 days. 26 days later I wrote an email complaining, as I had now missed a good portion of winter. I was given a $15 discount (which is around 11% of the order total). Felt this was fairly poor customer service and refund in general for having failed to live up to their end of the deal so blatantly."
663,"Lesson learned!  Read reviews before purchasing from a new vendor - I now understand why CampSaver has such terrible reviews online. As disappointed as I was with the inaccurate shipping information I received, I cannot even say that CampSaver at least provided a prepaid return shipping label for my inconvenience of having to purchase all the items locally after paying them for expedited shipping! Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired and requires a warning to all potential consumers to steer clear of CampSaver!"
664,"Got pants that had a messed up dye pattern, asked for exchange but asked that someone check first that the other pairs are not also seconds, got another pair of seconds, had to return that too, got a measly refund and spent a lot of effort and post office trips to deal with their errors."
665,"I saw a jacket on a website from Mammut . They did not have my size. I noticed it was on Camp Saver for $150.00 less, I read many of the not favorable reviews. Their website said only 1 left in Large.I called. I was immediately helped and told in fact  there was 1 left in the factory and it would be shipped the same day. I took a chance.I AM GLAD I DID .I received the perfect jacket in 3 days .Trust me, don't always believe negative reviews.Camp Saver is a quality company that I will use again and recommend to my friends ."
666,Prices may look good but it has happened far too many times for me where you think you're getting a great deal but they hold onto your paid order for weeks without shipping despite saying they have things in stock.  I think they do this deliberately.I won't be buying anything more from them.
667,"I order a pair of Patagonia shorts that were on sale for 36 dollars. It was a great sale and I thought it might be too good to be true but I ordered them anyways. I ordered them on Saturday, they shipped on Monday, and they arrived at my house on Thursday. I had no problems and it was a good experience!"
668,"Horrible experience. It took 45 minutes to complete the initial order because they had to do it via a online chat because their promo code on their home page didn't work. The person on the chat asked me to enter my credit card info on the chat and I refused because that is a huge security issue. Visa shouldn't allow this place to process credit cards with this type of relaxed policy. Finally, they sent me an invoice via email and I paid their email account like I was sending money to a friend via PayPal. So I find out they haven't shipped the item for 4 days despite their policy being a 1-2 days. Now I may not get the item in time and they would do nothing to fix it. They just say ""apologize"" over and over. It is within their power to ship the item at a faster speed but refused. This is a horrible company that doesn't respect customers whatsoever. I have spent almost an hour and a half dealing with one small order. Please do not order from this company!"
669,"Ordered from CampSaver on Amazon. They cancelled my order and stated Cancelled by Customer.  When Amazon looked into it they found that CampSaver cancelled the order. When contacted they said I would have to repurchase the items because Amazon cancelled the order. The original item was $120 full price and they had a discounted one available for $75, guess they felt that price was too low after all or maybe the already sold the item. Regardless, the customer service is poor and the company is deceiving in its practices."
670,"I ordered jacket Jan.3 before I read any of the reviews.I received the jacket by Jan.6th & it was just what I orderedand had seen at REI for full price, getting it for 15% less andpaying no 10% State sales tax.I was so pleased I ordered my husband the same Patagoniajacket in a different color"
671,"Called them up because I needed a rope for a climbing trip and was told unequivocally that if I paid the overnight shipping upcharge I would receive it on time. Waited patiently for shipping confirmation but never received it, called to confirm, no answer. the next day when it was supposed to arrive I finally did get an email that said they hadn't even shipped it yet. So now I don't have what I needed, am out the 45$ shipping and the rope is sitting on my front porch for the next 10 days. Three emails and no response."
672,"CampSaver said that they had inventory of an item that we knew was being discontinued soon.  We ordered it, and didn't hear back from them for weeks that they no longer had the item.  Everyone else had stopped carrying the item by that point.  Very frustrated and disappointed with them."
673,"I've ordered several things from CampSaver that I found on other sites, but was much cheaper when purchased here.  Shipping is not super-speedy, but it is totally free; even returns.  Everything I ordered was exactly as described and in great/new condition.  The return policy is fantastic as well.  It is hard to buy clothes online these days without trying them on first and it is nice to be able to easily send it back if it does not fit.  Now, I check CampSaver before buying anything that they might stock because of their low prices, great deals and great service."
674,"I really don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs up with all these bad reviews... ordered an Arcteryx jacket and it arrived in less than 2 weeks. Great quality! Very hard to find online and Camp saver had it!  I am not expecting amazon prime service for a small company like this. Happy customer, thank you."
675,"I ordered two pair of hiking shoes in same color (black/silver) recently, however they send my one black/silver and another black/bergot. I even paid import duty on delivery (I live in Canada), imaging what kind of hassles are getting to me. order from campsaver? think again!"
676,"Attempted to order a Stanley Adventure Cook + Brew set. I ordered it for an overnight kayaking/camping trip that was planned for 7 days after I placed my order with campsaver. I paid the additional postage for 3 day shipping. Later that same day I received an email from campsaver stating that my order would ship in an estimated 11-22 days. It took almost 45 minutes on hold for someone from C.S. to answer my call, this was after they didn‚Äôt respond to my C.S. email. I‚Äôm still waiting on my cancelation email.  Absolutely pathetic business practice!"
677,Overpriced and they don't list when items are back ordered. I found out after the item wasn't going to ship for 24 days!  How can a site even stay in business doing that . Customer service was rude and unwilling to work with their customers after falsely advertising what was in stock.
678,"Bought a jacket that was IN STOCK,  3 weeks later the item still wasn't shipped. I emailed and asked for an update or to cancel my order. Got an email back simply saying my order was cancelled,no apology for the wait or anything. Total fraud of a company. Avoid at all cost. SCAM!"
679,"Got a great deal on a bunch of gear.  They had a big sale and I was able to get a number of items for super cheap.  Also, after I bought some things, I noticed a coupon go up the next day.  I called their customer support and they applied the coupon retroactively to my earlier order and sent me a refund for the amount that the coupon would have saved me.  Very friendly and helpful customer service.  I have no idea why their score on Trustpilot is so low, I had a fantastic experience with them and got a bunch of stuff for significantly cheaper than anywhere else."
680,"Being rather adventurous, I ordered a 650$ tent at campsaver's to be shipped to Germany without spending too much time reading all the negative reviews. I wondered how it might work out and how long it would take for the tent to eventually arrive ‚Äì will we be alright for summer vacation or did I just dump some cash in the Atlantic Ocean? And I was pleasantly surprised: everything went smooth and quick; the parcel was seamlessly tracked and arrived a little more than a week later (earlier than noted). My overall experience was very good, didn't have to contact customer service though."
681,"I too was nervous to order from here due to the negative reviews but decided to go ahead and give them a chance. The item I ordered was perfect, shipping wasn't super fast but not slow either and tracking number was provided. Will be ordering from them again."
682,Emails get sent at a rate of one per day. Verification of card details is a joke. Payed for express shipping only to find that it‚Äôs been seven days and still it‚Äôs not been shipped. You‚Äôd get better service from a blind and deaf merchant in a Turkish bazaar.
683,"Lots of bad reviews of CampSaver made me hesitant to use them but my experience was only positive. Received a discount code for my first purchase, which was only good for one item. I was in between two sizes, I reached out to them and they allowed me to use the discount for both items to ensure I got the right size. Both items shipped quickly and arrived within a few days. Be sure to look at the shipping time for your item, some items say they won't ship for a week or more and I think that's where the bad reviews are coming from saying their items aren't arriving. Customer service has been quick to respond both times I reached out."
684,Bought a UL tent not currently being sold in Europe. It was on sale so I got it cheap even with the import duty.It arrived in about 2 weeks and looks great. Can't wait to use it.The only bad thing about campsaver is the mail spam you get but you can just unsubscribe.
685,"Ordered a winter jacket on Nov.26.  Got an email a day later saying my order would ship in 7-21 days.  I tried calling on Dec. 26, but I just got music.  Nobody ever answered.  I emailed them to cancel my oder.  The email option says someone will contact me back by email within 24 hours.  On 12/31, I had gotten no response.  I emailed again....  This is the worst customer service and order experience I have ever had.  Now it's almost January.  I have no winter coat.  I'm afraid to go buy one because I might get another one in a month or two from Campsaver.  Do NOT order from this company."
686,"I just want to leave CampSaver an amazing review on my moose knuckle 3q coat I just received. Iam inlove! I was so worried after seeing so many bad reviews about this site and this coat is awesome! Also, it came in less than a week! Thank you so much!"
687,"Very disappointed with the business interaction I had with CampSaver. I placed an order and it did not tell me it was on a 5 week backorder until AFTER the transaction went through. I immediately emailed their customer support to cancel the order. I did not get a response so i sent about 6 more emails and called a few times and still no response. Finally about 5 1/2 weeks later they responded (after it shipped) to tell me ""unfortunately the order cannot be canceled as it has already shipped"". It is obvious they ignored my request to cancel the order until well after it was too late to do so. What a shady, dishonest practice."
688,"I had ordered something online that show it is in stock on January 1. I received an email that said I would be receiving it in 3 to 5 days. Several days later I get an email that it is out of stock and it would be shipping in two weeks. I follow up three weeks later and the date moved. I followed up again and the date has moved two times the first time the date moved . Horrible customer service, horrible communication, extremely poor online inventory system ‚Äì I will not order from them again and do not recommend that anyone does. It‚Äôs not been a good experience heal their service is acceptable"
689,"While I don't doubt all the negative reviews regarding shipping and customer service, I just wanted to chime in that not every transaction is such.Despite looking over these reviews and similar on other sites, they had a backpacking tent I wanted for $60 cheaper than anywhere else. I didn't need it until October and didn't have any concern if they were to not charge my card until the order shipped (as others have complained), so I went ahead and ordered.I ordered on a Saturday night and got the package delivered (from Utah to Phoenix, AZ area) the following Friday! No issues with product or anything else here."
690,"I have ordered several time from this group. They have a good selection for my outdoor interests, and have been on par or better than other online stores I have purchased from.  Keep up the good work Campsaver.com. Seth AndersonGrand Junction, Colorado."
691,"I'm an avid online shopper for outdoor gear. Camp saver is the only place I was able to find a Patagonia jacket in a discontinued color, however I was disappointed when I was sent a ""payment verification"" email a couple days later. This email read almost like a virus, requesting that I respond in ten days or else my order would be canceled. I was given two different, difficult options involving calling my bank and providing campsaver with personal account information. I have never seen anything like this and am wary of following through with my order. Shouldn't my credit card information be enough?"
692,"I'm debating on if I should order from this website because I read all of the bad reviews and it makes me nervous. There were also good reviews, but not as much as bad ones. I would be happy if anyone can reply to let me know what I should do. Thank you."
693,"Their inventory used to be a lot better but after the recent revamp, many items are not in stock and they do not update you until you email them. Quite a disappointment, considering how they used to be one of my go-to sites to purchase outdoor gears."
694,I started Google shopping camping products to get the best deal. Campsavers came up as the best option for price. The product and service was great and the email discounts are unbeatable. Try it out the next time you are thinking of spending more at REI.
695,Ordered 4 identical items in a size large.  Received them as a size small.  Completed return and second shipment had the exact same WRONG sized items.  I called customer service for a full refund.  I'll pay extra to work with a different business.
696,"I bought an $800 Thermal Binocular here and returned it, and I am having to file a PayPal dispute to get my money back. I will never buy anything here again!"
697,"At this point I have to say 1 star, I placed my order on November 30 and my status says ‚Äúorder placed‚Äù. It has been over a month! And I have only received a generic email reply to my email asking about the order. This is unacceptable."
698,"I had an excellent experience with these guys! Everywhere I looked this sweater with $195 Canadian, so when I saw it listed here for significantly less I was skeptical. It didn‚Äôt help that there was an extreme mix of reviews online, however, some of the negative reviews are senseless and dumb.  I placed my order on January 30, and received it today, February 11. Not sure where they are located,But I am in Toronto, Canada so I don‚Äôt know if that is standard time for them or not. I didn‚Äôt have to deal with customer service for any reason so I can‚Äôt give an opinion on that but the prices, shipping speed and customer satisfaction our way up for this guy"
699,"I had a very positive shopping experience with CampSaver.com.  I ordered a pair of shoes, much cheaper than anywhere else, and a pair of socks.  There was also a promotion with the shoes that allowed me to get another pair of socks free.  Due to a glitch in their system or even my fault my free sock did not ship with my order.  I contacted customer service and had a response with in 24 hours.  They bent over backwards to give me multiple options to fix the issue.  In the end I got the socks in my original order for free.Great prices, great customer service, and great products.  Don't be afraid to order and save a lot of money."
700,The worst experience ever on online shopping.They sell products they don't have and say it's in stocks. I've been waiting for my item over a month.They don't even bother replying to my email. No apologies no explanations. Repulsive.
701,"I ordered two Exped Megamat 10 Duo camp mattresses from Campsaver. They were on sale for 30% off (a $230 saving) so I ordered them without hesitation. After 4 days I had not received a shipping notice and I started to get worried having read all the bad reviews about them selling things that they don‚Äôt actually have in stock. On the fifth day after I placed my order I was about to call them, but I got a shipping notice and the mattresses arrived in NYC 6 days after that. I did not interact with their customer service, so I can‚Äôt speak of that. My experience was thankfully a positive one. However, I don‚Äôt doubt the negative reviews and would advise caution."
702,"I ordered from them before I saw the reviews. Had I seen the reviews I probably wouldn't have. However, I'm glad I did (but I also acknowledge that I never had to deal with customer service either).I'm leaving a review because I think the review average doesn't tell the whole story.  My experience, ordered luggage ($30 cheaper per bag than anywhere else) on Thursday (1 week before my flight). Paid extra for 2-day shipping. They shipped it Monday and it came Wednesday night. Not super impressed with the delay to ship but very happy with the price.In short, it seems that they have great prices as long as you can afford to wait longer than you would expect."
703,"I ordered a pair of shoes on November 9, 2018 and have still not received them as of January 3, 2019. Originally, I was told it would be at my home in 5-10 days! This is absolutely unacceptable and I do not recommend this company."
704,"Really a bad Costumer Service. I bought an Umbrella on August 14th, then email the Customer S ricce on the same day to change the color of the Umbrella. It‚Äôs been more than 1 month that I neither get a reply from them, neither I got my Umbrella (of any color). I called the Tollfree number 3 times, waited for 5/6 minutes each time and my phone got answered on 3rd time. After my phone call, they sent me a Mailing Sticker of my shipment. Like really?. I‚Äôm 34 days, they didn‚Äôt even processed my order for shipment. I am really frustrated. Will never buy stuff from this site. I suggest all of you to buy products through Amazon, that‚Äôs too fast and convenient."
705,"Read the reviews. Caveat emptor. Very slow to process orders, quick to charge your card however. 9 days after ordering, shipping label created 2 days after ordering. A week and counting, USPS still has not received."
706,"I am oversea customer and had BAD experience last week..Got a email that my order has been cancelled and ask CS the reason behind, would like recap what Ryan@Campsaver replied: ""we are no longer interested in doing business with you and campsaver reserves the right to refuse to do business with anyone if we choose, at this moment we choose not to do business with you, this is all the information i am allowed to provide you.""This is the services what Campsaver provide? I don't care the goods now, just want someone to follow up with that terrible service, my order# 10903575, i also keep the email record with Ryan for backup. Again, feel disappointed!!"
707,"The return process is about as terrible as you can imagine. It's not streamlined at all, they take their sweet time in processing the items once they are received, and THEN they try to convince you that you returned a used product to them, so you can only receive store credit. I received a number of emails rejected by their (full) customer service inbox, the customer service line doesn't get answered (I waited on hold for so long!).... the only way I finally got ahold of someone was via chat.Truly a nightmare!On the plus side, I didn't have the experience that many others are reporting of the product being out of stock or taking months to ship, so there's that!"
708,"I recently ordered Boreas Bolinas 30 L Backpack and thought I was ordering it in the Lunar Black color scheme like the images provided on the website. To my surprise I received the 2015 ""Eclipse"" color scheme of black/gold none of which was indicated anywhere on the web page. Had I known I would not have ordered it. To make matters worse they could not reserve the proper replacement since it was out of stock. I will have to join their email list and call them once its back in stock in order to exchange it. Very inconvenient, it is not that difficult to keep up to date information on the site. A irresponsible vendor for sure! Be warned don't get mislead."
709,"Good experience.A reliable and flexible partner,both in shipping and returning of items.Campsaver customer service is efficient and friendly.They are good at work they do,and I wouldcertainlyorder again!   Recommended!"
710,"Communication is poor, while they do not have a contact number listed they also do not reply back via email. My order was supposed to be delivered 15 days ago which obviously did not reach me. Upon checking I found out Courier company is sending it back due to missing invoice. The first email they replied that they will send and give new shipping information but after 15 days still no updates. I have requested them for update via email, Twitter, Facebook.Funny thing is even without receiving the item I get emails from them asking how do I like my item :D Anyways, my verdict is not reliable at all. I wouldn't mind spending $50-$60 more at other stores for better service. I had to postpone my trips."
711,The worst customer service experience. After ordering an item one week ago and after multiple questions from me about when the item would ship I was finally told the item ‚Äúshould ship today.‚Äù After two more days the item had not shipped so I responded to the same email to be rudely told ‚ÄúI said it ‚Äòshould‚Äô ship today not that it ‚Äòwould.‚Äô‚Äù Quality customer service interaction.Giving it a few more days I inquired to see if the item was in stock or back ordered. I was told it was in stock and was preparing to ship. Exactly 2 hours later I was informed my order was cancelled because the item was not in stock.Horrible experience and I will not be making any future purchases from Campsaver.
712,"I ordered anyways despite being nervous because of the negative reviews. However, I had a great experience.My Marmot down sleeping bag arrived via UPS (w/ tracking) within 4 days of ordering and I'm loving it."
713,"I was hesitant to make a purchase from Campsaver due to the reviews but I thought that I'd take a chance, I am glad that I did!I placed my order on Saturday for a Mountain Hardware Super Bird ski jacket, it arrived at my house via UPS on Thursday. Of course I didn't order the jacket last minute, needing it for a trip right away so I had nothing to be panicked by a late arrival or fit. I didn't need to deal with their customer service, hopefully it isn't as bad as described by others.The jacket was as described on the Campsaver and other websites and the fit was exact for me. Campsaver will be one of my future go to retailers when I need outdoor gear. BTW the price that I paid couldn't be beat anywhere!"
714,"I was pretty stoked to find that campsaver had the headlight I had been looking for (Oculus 650 by Ultraspire) at a pretty nicely discounted price. $113 for a $160 light. Well, after it arrived I noticed that the packaging had obviously already been opened/repackaged (item was listed as brand new on their site) and the light had a faulty charging system, wouldn‚Äôt work in all modes, and had seemingly been used previously. They obviously re-sold me an already returned faulty light at a ‚Äúdiscount.‚Äù Thankfully UltraSpire themselves has top notch customer service and they took care of me, but I will never shop at CampSaver again and would recommend those of you reading this review do the same. Shady business practices. Stay away!!!!"
715,"First of all, Guys don't be bothered campsaver has no customer service. Even if they do, they will keep saying the same thing over and over. Your product will be shipped out shortly which is a lie.I copied and pasted one of review someone left down here because the exactly the same thing is happening to me, too. -Quote ""Prices may look good but it has happened far too many times for me where you think you're getting a great deal but they hold onto your paid order for weeks without shipping despite saying they have things in stock. I think they do this deliberately.""-I placed an order Monday before sunrise. still, have not receiveda shipping notification. They ruined our family trip. It's Friday today already."
716,They said estimate 20-30 day delivery.  Talked with someone on their website chat.  He told me it could take up to a year! What kind of company is this? I wouldnt recommend doing any business with them.
717,"I paid for a product Jan 13,2019 and they mentioned on back order less than 24 business days it should be on its way. Little communication on this after reaching out and I have fully been charged and NOW above 40+ BUSINESS days waiting for the product. No care to communicate the excess amount and still have not even offered to resolve this in any other way. Still do not have the shipping details and when I reached out they offered a minimal resolution now that the winter season is basically over. Avid outdoors individual and ordered very large items with no issues similar to this, these items are very small and not heavy at all. I would not recommend this company, go to backcountry, thehouse or anywhere else before this group."
718,"I read these reviews several times.   I ordered a Garmin Montana 700i GPS.  I called customer service several times.   Everyone I spoke was very courteous and tried to help me and answer my questions.  I had to do a manual deposit verification.  After that I got a $35 discount.  Originally I got a 20% discount.  When I placed the order no one had a Montana 700i in stock.   I was not charged until the shipment was initiated.  They found a company who had one in stock and it came today.  A brand new one in pristine condition.   Not only did they get me my product, when everyone including Garmin, was out of stock, but I got it for about $190 off, with free shipping.  I got my product in about three weeks from ordering.   The product was ""out of stock"" when ordered."
719,Bad experience. They told me to manual verify my credit card after few days from my order and never reply my email. Ok...fine... i place my second order with paypal; somehow they cancel my order. SO RUDE!
720,"I had the most incredible experience where ups  dropped the ball, but camp saver picked it up and ran it into the end zone.  They truly value you as a customer and make it easy to do business with them"
721,"Decided to 'risk it' since the price was good, despite the subpar Trustpilot reviews.Ordered 1 item for around $50 USD. Received expected item. The shipping timing was good and reasonable."
722,"On Septenmber 19th, I placed a $655 order with Campsaver and revieved a PayPal reciept. This reciept said that 'Campsaver would contact me to complete the order'. After 36 hours and nothing, I wrote to them. They responded another day later saying they had no record. I sent them the PayPal reciept as proof...they simply replied - Call Customer Service. No explaination, no appolpgies.. Nothing. So in the mean time, the sale finished and the prices went UP. So I called, FROM AUSTRALIA, ON MY DIME. They reinstated the order... And then cancelled it again 24 hours later with an email seriously trying to Antagonise me... There is alot more to this story but I'm fed up.THE VERY WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE INTERNET.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
723,"Just wanted to give a big thanks to customer service and Shauna H. She was super responsive and was able to fully resolve my issue. Can‚Äôt thank her enough, would do business with again.-Steve"
724,"I searched the web and thought I had found the best deal on a Phantom Spark 28 sleeping bag. I ordered it and received a Phantom 32 in the mail. I brought up chat and spoke with a rep of the company, only to have them tell me that the online ad was wrong..ALL WRONG and that the one I ordered was a clearance from last year so it's a 32. NO WHERE on the website did it state this!! He said my options was to get my money back OR PAY THE DIFFERENCE...to get THE BAG I ORIGINALLY ORDERED! REALLY! I should have just been able to exchange the two since it's their fault that their add is all screwed up. Not happy with this company, will never use it again, would not recommend it...you'll never know what you'll end up with after you order, how can you trust them?"
725,"I‚Äôve bought from CS before and was impressed by the price and the speed of delivery etc.A couple of weeks ago I bought something (on a Friday) from them using a different card and they sent me an email saying they were holding the transaction until I verified the card. I had to choose one of two options. I went the quicker one but because it was a Friday afternoon it didn‚Äôt get processed till Monday (when I called and spoke to a nice enough customer service rep). By Weds all was verified and the order has shipped (should arrive today/tomorrow).While my idea of a ‚Äúfast option‚Äù is that it gets done in a day or two (not five), everything has gone smoothly, customer service was helpful and the purchase is due to arrive tomorrow (according to UPS).I would shop with them again."
726,I bought a pair of hiking shoes after much research that were rated on the top and were at a great price on CampSavers. The first pair were big so I called and they sent me a no cost return label and I was also able to place the order for a replacement pair. I opted for them to first receive this current pair before sending me the second pair. I tried out the second pair with different socks and insoles and put around 3 miles on them. But still my feet could not get used to the shoes. Called back again and told them my story. I got a no cost return label and a full refund. This is the first time I am shopping online for shoes. CampSaver with their level of service made it a good experience for me...just like going to the store. Thank you for the good service.
727,"This place is silly. I made 2 separate orders for Columbia pants etc. After 5 - 6 weeks they contact me & advise all of the products I ordered - and that they took the money for - are all unavailable. ??? It‚Äôs kind of weird. There are many accounts of this in the other reviews below, of which I quite believe. I have unsubscribed to all of their emails & offers. However, I cannot deny that their customer service was honest, quick, straight forward and polite to me. They have notified me of a full refund (unsolicited) and have been completely cooperative. I think I‚Äôve read some negative stuff about their customer service below, but I had absolutely no problems.However, fine customer service does not alone a company make -and I‚Äôm still disappointed. I was really looking forward to the products that I ordered."
728,Great experience with this company. The tent I got was a little different than I thought. Campsaver offered several options to fix the problem--great customer sales and service.
729,"I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say one way or another I seen 100 dollars off what I wanted which was a dare good deal, I order and after ordering I started research on them, doesn‚Äôt look like they have very good review and I was just about to see if their reviews where true. The deal breaker for me is campsaver contact me to verify my CC information which I thought was really weird never had that done before. Then I kept asking when would it be shipped bc I received two different shipping dates so I decided to cancel my order I will pay the extra 100 knowing I will receive my product when they say they will. Sorry campsaver you need to work on your rep. What I order was way to much money to get rip of or wait 90 days for it sorry I give a 2.5 Star bc I didn‚Äôt give you a chance to prove yourself or to let me down"
730,HORRIBLE!  I so wish that I had read the reviews before ordering from them.  I am concerned that they now have information about me.  For sure this is NOT a legit site!
731,"When I first heard about CampSaver.com, I was excited. As a SAR team member, having to buy our own gear means needing to be have a good site to buy from that has both good selection and good prices. We need retailers that are dependable. Unfortunately, CampSaver isn‚Äôt in that category. My first order had a 20% coupon on the entire order which was great. From there, the experience went down quickly as backordered items with projected delivery dates kept getting pushed out for months after I ordered them, and their Customer Service is silent to inquiries for help.As such, this is not a dependable site to order from. I‚Äôve lost multiple coupons due to the fact that my orders never came and resulted in the coupons expiring. There are many more sites to choose from I‚Äôve found that give good deals, good service, and don‚Äôt play the backordered timing games."
732,They almost got me I was searching for power supplies portable and I was going to buy it something from Jacobi jackery or jackety something like that it was a little too much expensive so I went back to Facebook and I scroll down and Bam üí•right there is the ad for this camping gear I just was looking at..somehow they traced my search query then reproduced it in my fb news feed it had to be an algorithmic fraud scheme..they tried to sell me some stuff at 70% off and just right there at the end I didn't feel right about so I backed out... I put in my 3-digit security code and I didn't press enter  something felt off so I erased it & backed out..I feel that must've been a good choice after looking at all these reviews and it says that it's a fake place so I'm a real person far as I know I would not shop here.. if it looks too good to be true it usually is.
733,"""The stupid credit card verification kill this company... No recommend if you want to waste your time send it stupid emails with stupid confirmations . YOU GUYS SUCKS !!!!"""
734,I ordered  my Prana pants Aug. 20 and received them by Aug. 25!  Quick shipping with emailed tracking number! Great customer service! great products!Thank you CampSaver!
735,"Like many buyers, the negative reviews made me nervous about ordering from Campsaver. I had ordered from them many years ago without issue. However, I wasn't sure if anything had changed since then. This ordering dilemma came about because Campsaver is the only online U.S. vendor selling the Rab Expedition 7000 jacket. The website stated that my size was in stock, which made it difficult to pass up. I really wanted this item over any competing product, so I decided to take the risk ordering. The ordering process was easy and I was able to take advantage of a 20% discount code. The order shipped within 48 hours using the shipping method I selected. I received the order without issues and was very pleased upon opening the box. The item was in brand new condition, and in the correct color and size. Best of all, this difficult to obtain jacket is amazing."
736,I ordered a pair of boots that were made with Goretex. They shipped me the non Goretex version and charged me $20 for return shipping. No customer service either.
737,"Their weird security procedure for credit card puchases was really off putting, but the goods were delivered in an expeditious manner and at price that was exceptional."
738,"Wow, I can't say enough about how poor the customer service is.  I didn't look at their reviews before purchasing.  If you look on their site, they only post positive reviews with almost all 5 ratings.  Every other review site I saw are terrible. This company has some serious issues. Had same experience as others.  They say item is in stock but doesn't send notification if it isn't.  After talking to them, they say it is in stock but don't know what the issue is.  They had no idea when it would be sent out and they had no way of finding out.  At least according to the person I spoke to.  They really fail when it comes to contacting customers after saying they will get in touch.  I will never buy from from this company again.  As long as you don't have to deal with their customer service, you should be okay.  But if something goes wrong, good luck."
739,"I recently made a purchase from campsaver. This was my first experience with them. I was a bit concerned, because of all the negative reviews. I ordered a pair of running shoes that were on clearance. After placing the order, I immediately received a confirmation email. I selected the free shipping option, so I wasn't expecting the shoes to be immediately shipped. The confirmation email provided a link to check the status of the order, which I did about every other day. After 6 days, I sent an email to customer service asking for an update. I received a response letting me know that they were behind on orders, but mine would ship soon. The next day I received a shipping confirmation. Today I received the shoes.I'm giving a rating of four, because even though the shipping was a little later than I anticipated the shoes arrived in good condition. I would order again from them."
740,"As others mentioned they are a scam. They show that they have items in stock, but don‚Äôt. They will hold until your money and never ship nor notify you. STAY CLEAR."
741,I purchased a Mammut jacket and beanie from campsaver. Shipping was on time and the price was unbeatable. I'll continue using this site and recommending it to others!
742,"Worst customer service ever. They sent the wrong shoes to us (2 pairs, both wrong), no big deal for me, crap happens. So I email them, tell them about their mistake and ask if they can just upgrade shipping for the right pairs of shoes for me since the others took a whole week to get here. They said no they wouldn't expedite shipping, but that I could order the new pair and then get a refund once they receive the returned shoes in the mail. Well come to find out, I can order the new pair of shoes, but they wont give me the money back, only a store credit so I have to use the money at their store.... I'm beyond frustrated. At this point their customer service isn't even responding and I have no idea if I'm even going to get the other money back now. It takes a lot to get me to write a review about a company, this might be the third ever, but I will never order from these people again."
743,"So I placed an order for a child bike seat. It was about 70$ cheaper on their website with a code and free ship included. They emailed me the next day that item was not in stock. However their website had said ‚Äúin stock‚Äù. This apparently was an outlet item, that they ship directly from the manufacturer. The manufacturer where the ones whom didn‚Äôt have said item available. They were polite enough to cancel my order, and refund me.  I ended up re-ordering the same item, but this time it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúoutlet‚Äù.  It was full price of 225$, however with a 30% code, I paid just about the same as the outlet priced seat. The item was shipped same day, and I received it in 3 days. Item is just as described. Overall if it wasn‚Äôt for the initial mix up, I would give company 5 stars. I contacted them through both phone and email, and never had issues. Taylor with customer service was a pleasure."
744,"Campsaver.com is hands down the worst online shopping experience I have ever been through‚Ä¢¬†They can't take card payments like any other company for some reason. You need to call them after you've made a purchase to verify your card details again. They need to take *the entire series of credit card numbers again* over the phone, to post a small transaction to that credit card. You have to wait a subsequent few hours for that amount to show up. It's almost like they don't want you to purchase things from them, given how many hoops they make you jump through.‚Ä¢¬†Their office hours to do all of the above are needlessly restrictive‚Ä¢¬†Very regularly, upon calling the office during office hours, no one picks up‚Ä¢¬†They can't do anything useful regarding the above over email. It has to be done over the phone.Avoid avoid avoid. Unless you enjoy having your time being wasted."
745,Bait and keep telling you it will ship soon.  Three months and nothing.  Web says and said three months ago it will ship in two weeks.  Just don't buy from them
746,I was on the mobile site and bought a kelty Gunnison tent for a trip I had coming up. The tentire I was looking for happened to be on sale so I bought it. When the tent arrived in the mail I noticed the poles that were pictured were not included with the tent. Nowhere does it say that. I checked the website again to make sure before calling and the same tent was on sale for even cheaper now! I bought it a few days ago and now it's much cheaper! 100% price guarantee is a lie. I called and polietly explained the situation and they said to return the tent. Then they charged me 7.50 for shipping because there was nothing wrong with the tent! What a ripoff. The mistake was their fault and I had to pay for it. If they would have been willing to discount the poles I would have kept the tent but they would rather have a unhappy customer and return the tent. This place sucks.
747,They just canceled our order for no reason and without informing us. I had to go to my account to see this. Sent them an email but no reply. Very unhappy.
748,"This site is a massive hassle to do business with. First their site is insufficiently set up to check items can ship to the specified destination. They cancelled my order without warning the next day. Next they required verification of my payment method. Despite already charging or placing ""holds"" on my card. Where else in the world are they so paranoid about fraudulent payments that they refuse to honour an order unless you verify a test transaction. This is a massive hassle slowing down shipping and making the whole shopping process a complete pain. Next time I will go somewhere else where they value their customers time and work to help the customer rather than mess them around. When I place an order and pay I expect the order to be shipped within 24 hours or an explanation of an inventory issue provided. I believe this to be reasonable as every other place I shop is capable of it."
749,Order my boots 1 month ago. Went to website today to check order status. It's scheduled to ship in 3 months. I'm cancelling immediately. Beware!
750,"They suck!!! Don‚Äôt order from them, it‚Äôs not free returns unless you accept a campsaver credit for their overpriced items. So regret ordering from them"
751,This store told me 'Out of stock' after 3 weeks later I ordered.I waste 3 weeks!They don't care Inventory.Don't use this store.This is the worst.
752,"It is rare that I feel impassioned enough to write a negative review for a company, but in this case I cannot contain my disappointment and frustration with this company.  I have had slow order delivery in the past and especially around Christmas you expect this.  However, when you place an order for over $135.00 dollars, and on the 6th day after ordering  it still hasn't processed, you know there is a problem.  I come to find out my entire order was being held because a clearance item that was less than $3.00 was on back order - until sometime close to a month after my order.  They would have actually held my order for another 2-3 weeks until that item came in.  Madness.  To make it worse, I am still waiting 3 days later for UPS to get my package.  I won't get my package in time for my hike and I ordered within the 10 business days but Campsaver failed.  Needless to say, Campsaver has lost another customer."
753,These clowns have lost the parcel and won‚Äôt send the replacement for four weeks and ask for 124USD postage to resend? Ffs stay away‚Ä¶
754,Horrible. Avoid buying from this company. I placed an order (without checking reviews for this website)... Big Mistake...Bought a jacket on sale (black friday) and 5 days later it has still not shipped. According to customer service the Jacket has left their warehouse and is with UPS. It states clearly on UPS's website that only a Label has been generated and they are still waiting for the product from Campsaver. Meanwhile I am out a serious chunk of change. I sent them an email that they simply ignored and then tried calling Campsaver... no one answers and kept me on hold for 30 mins with elevator music. The only way I could contact them was through online chat.How is this company surviving? Seems to be a scam. I am praying I get my money back some how. I have to file a claim after 10 days. Convenient that I have to do all the work and they just sit pretty on my cash. AVOID AVOID AVOID. Will update how this goes as and when I get more information.
755,I was nervous ordering from here after reading mixed reviews but arrived on time!No problems for me..Will be ordering again for sure
756,"Me: It wasn't supposed to be a store credit. It was supposed to be a refund. Respectfully,Campsaver: Thank you for your email, according to the notes on your RMA, your return was sent back to us used, and with used items we can only issue store credit. Me: Oh. My. God. It's running shoes. I ran 2 miles in them and they nearly destroyed my legs. How are you supposed to test running shoes without running in them?????? That's a bunch of crap. I returned them within 30 days--which is what all shoes stores give you--and with the tags. You guys owe me a refund. Campsaver: Thank you for your email, respectfully, the shoes were returned used and show signs of that use, they cannot be sold as new, and as per our returns policy we can only issue store credit for them, even if you returned them within 30 days.Me: That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. They're running shoes. It's impossible to test running shoes without wearing them. I'm not doing business with you guys again."
757,"Had ordered the Kuat NV 2 with a coupon code. The following day, they said it is not available. They had offered me to pick something else and they would supposedly give it to me at the same price as the kuat witha coupon code. Really did bot want anything so i figured i just might wait for the kuat to become available. When checking the website, it atill shows up as avaialble. The customer support guy told me it was just a glitch. The following day, the kuatvwas stll available, now at a lower base price. I really am not sure whether it is still a glitch, bit it feels deceptive somehow. Just got off their email support again. Now they are saying that they dont carry kuat anymore and the reason why it is popping up on their website is that they have the same inventory as their sister website. They probably just do not want to give the discounted price since if they have the same inventory, they should be able to pull it off the inventory. Please do not order from this website. Very much bait and switch."
758,Tried to return a Vasque Hiking boots.  Would not accept without original box.  Do not do business with this company!  Be warned.
759,"First time ordering from camp saver and thought the 20% off coupon for a pair of adidas hiking shoes was too good to be true. Reading the trust pilot reviews made me believe it was a bait and switch website possibly. I called customer service to check on the size availability since every size said low stock 1 left. The agent answered the call promptly and assured me they had it in stock. I then decided to roll the dice since the price with discount was too good to pass up. After placing the order I the used the chat feature to verify order was received and if there would be a delay in shipping. Again the agent confirmed it would be shipping shortly. Few hours later I received a preparing to ship notification and then an email with tracking number. I paid a few extra dollars for 3-5 day shipping since I needed the shoes for trip in 7 days and I received the shoes in 3 days. As a few other reviews say, make sure the site shows the show in stock before ordering. I had zero issues with customer service and shipping speed. I will be sure to purchase here again in the future."
760,I‚Äôd give a zero if it was possible. 2 months since order has been placed and nothing. Zero. Nadda. What a joke.
761,"I ordered a duffel bag 4 weeks ago and its taking so long to get shipped. I sent a message through facebook messenger and email. The one on the messenger told me that the duffel bag that I ordered are not in their stock yet so I need to wait until Nov. 14 to get their stock back, and then the customer service rep upgraded my shipping to 2 day shipping once its on stock. I was happy. But then, that afternoon after I talked to someone on facebook messenger, an email was sent to me by campsaver customer service rep that my order was no longer available through their site. And he/she said that its discontinued being produced by the manufacturer. Two different things was told to me by two different reps online. I asked the one on the email on what bag that is 45 linear inches in size is available, but instead of giving me an option of a different color of my order, he/she offered me a different kind of bag. So I assumed that the design of the bag that I ordered whatever color it is was discontinued to get manufactured. Then why it is still on your website until this date? Long story short, I got my order cancelled."
762,"Most bad I reviews I read are during covid times. I know it may not justify the bad customer service a lot of you have ecoericned during these times but I personally had a great experience with this company and I was completely shocked to see such bad reviews. I ordered 2 exped megamats which as some of you may know, they're very expensive. One shipped and the other didn't because it was back-ordered. The one that shipped was somehow lost in transit and it never arrived. I emailed them and told them I would just buy it elsewhere and they immediately refunded me. I have a friend who ordered and all was good with his order. Hopefully they get back on track witj the issued they're having due to covid and this is a company I can recommended for sure, even though as I mentioned I have not had any issues with them.Update  9-18-21I recently placed another order from these guys. I received an email that there would be a problem with my order and it would ship about a week later than expected. Then the very next day I received an email that it was in transit. Again, not sure how a few people keep having bad luck with them. All my 3 orders have been great. Will buy from them again without hesitation."
763,"Scam-Site. You'll not receive your order, will not get a refund (even through PayPal) and cannot contact them."

"Received an incomplete order. Sended an email 3 times, without any answer. Still missing one shirt."
"They sent me a false tracking number and then reply that the item was probably lost and that they can send me again but then nothing, no answers. In fact they replied me telling my email was in spam accidentally but then when I ask for a refund they never answered again??€?"
"ZERO STARSOrdered goods marketed as Italian, which is fraud as they are obviously manufactured in China. Shipping would take around three to four days, Three weeks later and still not received the goods. Again, fraud. Someone ought to sue the s**t out of Zartoni."
"It??€?s been over a week, sad to see these reviews, crazy that instagram is filled with these bogus sites. Second time this year fell for a bogus site. Only ordering through amazon from now on. Hate this nonsense."
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THE PRODUCT IS SUB-PAR AND RUNS WAY TO SMALL THEY REFUSE TO RETURN MY EMAILS PER THEIR POLICY. DO NOT PURCHASE ITS GARBAGE LOOKS LIKE ITS MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE
The worst online service about. Do not purchase from this business. Item never arrives and customer service is simply useless. Do not purchase from this business.

Buyer BewareDo not use this company they are scammers and operate in a fraudulent manner.  Action has been taken against this company and they will be handled accordingly so they are held accountable and are not able to defraud any more innocent customers.All of their responses are generic and hold no value.  Worst experience in all my online shopping experience.  If you value your money that you work hard for - DO NOT use this company.
"Worst online shopping experience i have ever had. Ordered a Jersey. Waited a week to have the money returned back to me with no explanation or follow up email. Just completely awful and rude costumer service, buy your jersey ANY where else."

"This is a terrible company with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They shipped my order to the wrong country, refused to correct their mistake and stopped answering their emails. I finally managed to get my order sent to me (no thanks to this company) and the pants I ordered are about 6 inches too short! Do yourself a favor and avoid them like the plague."
Terrible shipping... Have not recieved my shirt in over a month. They have no control over their sales and terrible customer support.
The pants fall apart after a few washings and the zippers break easily on the pockets.  Customer service is terrible and this company is garbage. Don't waste your money.
Terrible customer service and impossible to make returns or exchanges.So unimpressed and while their clothes arent bad I will no longer be a customer for this reason. It's just not worth it.
Never buy in South Africa !!!!What a surprise this morning ! I need to pay 56 dollars customs fees to release the parcel.(after 7weeks shipping)I did not saw any warnings when I bought on line !!! Very bad customer experience services!!!!!
The worst customer service on the planet Very deceptive Absolutely the worst company everThey stole my money
"Bought a jacket that was IN STOCK,  3 weeks later the item still wasn't shipped. I emailed and asked for an update or to cancel my order. Got an email back simply saying my order was cancelled,no apology for the wait or anything. Total fraud of a company. Avoid at all cost. SCAM!"
The worst experience ever on online shopping.They sell products they don't have and say it's in stocks. I've been waiting for my item over a month.They don't even bother replying to my email. No apologies no explanations. Repulsive.
"""The stupid credit card verification kill this company... No recommend if you want to waste your time send it stupid emails with stupid confirmations . YOU GUYS SUCKS !!!!"""
I was nervous ordering from here after reading mixed reviews but arrived on time!No problems for me..Will be ordering again for sure

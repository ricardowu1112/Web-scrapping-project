I went onto amazon and searched and found the exact same jackets that I ordered from Angel Jackets but for HALF the price that Angel Jackets is selling them for. And on top of that, Angel Jackets charges a restocking fee - which Amazon does not! And you also have to pay return shipping. I really wish I had noticed this before ordering from Angel Jackets. I feel so ripped off right now.',\n",
       " 'The jacket purchased for my husband fits perfectly, couldn’t be happier and I do intend to be a repeat customer. Highly recommend Angel Jackets. Customer service was spot on as we were asked if we were purchasing the correct size .. we were and we did!!',\n",

I considered ordering a size up, based on a few reviews, but was glad that I did not as it fits true to size. There was an unpleasant odour when I first unpacked it, but after a few hours it had aired out and now smells like fresh leather. I love it!',\n",
       " 'I am wowed by the value of my jacket. The attractive yet suspiciously low price had me questioning the jacket’s quality.but after studying Angel Jacket’s return policy and following their detailed sizing guide, I was reassured that ordering this jacket online was not risky. I am ecstatic with my purchase. The fit and the soft quality leather satisfies me 100%. This was a five star purchase.',\n",
       " 'I did a search for a leather jacket. After spending some time searching, I was taken by the look and styles of the jackets sold by this company. I found what I was looking for and was lucky that they had a promotion to go with it. The follow up emails were prompt and informative. The shipping was quick and free.

I have tried to contact the customer care twice to cancel the order as Paypal suggested. No response. I don't know the quality of the jackets, but your customer care doesn't match the quality to satisfy a customer. Customer care should not be provided only if you purchase something. For sure you have lost one even before I buy anything.\",\n",

It is slightly thinner (and therefore lighter) than a cow leather jacket I own but this is lambskin which will be perfect for spring and autumn. I am honestly stoked!

The New Horizons downtown is my favorite for that special novelty gift and cards galore.  If you haven’t stopped by one of these stores, it is a must on Pittsboro and worth your drive!

After being disappointed with my last attempt at finding clothes for work, I started looking into online made-to-measure services.  Tailor Store was the only service/website with good reviews that also had a measurement system that made sense. The 1st few times the fit of the clothes was close but not quite right but customer service came through and made everything right. Communication with customer service was excellent and once the adjustments to the measurements were made, the fit of the clothes was perfect. Over the past few months, I have ordered 15 dress shirts, 2 jackets, 3 suits and a few pairs of pants.  All arrived quick and were packed well. The craftsmanship of the clothing and fabric quality are awesome.\",\n",

In my pursuit to have the perfect silhouette, I have revisited luxire for alteration of my existing pair and they have always done it for free, in addition based on picture references I shared, they even modified the measurements, all remotely. I cannot stop buying from them, given the incredible experience I am having.',\n",
       " \"I've been buying pants from Luxire for about 3 months now. I had to go through some trial and error for fitting but my last pair was perfect and I will continue to purchase from Luxire for many years to come.Thank you\",\n",
       " 'Email consultation is almost perfect.(fit advice or any questions)I’m bewildered by how Luxire could put so much effort into 1:1 email conversation with a customer.Actually I feel somewhat apologetic when I ask too many and long questions, to which Luxire always kindly answers.',\n",
       " 'Good experience with the first pair of trousers. Some adjustments had to be made after the first try-on but Luxire agreed to take care of that (as much as can be done). Still some finetuning to be done on the next pair but I am happy with the first pair and will certainly order again.',\n",
       " 'Luxire for the perfect Ghurka pants !Top fit en cloth !!!Jan van den Donk',\n",
       " 'NOT based in Munich. Ordered some trousers that were sent from Asia. Be prepared that if you order here you will need to pay additional custom costs. Pants are too small, recommendation would be 1-2 sizes bigger for average europeans.',\n",
       " \"I really enjoy working with Luxire. The MtM can be a bit costly at first but Luxire helping me out with fine tuning with every single order and offered me quite a lot of discounts throughout my journey until we finally got to a fit where I'm very comfortable. The workmanship is absolutely beautiful and so are the fabrics and fit (obviously). COMMUNICATION is KEY.\",\n",
       " 'Wonderful experience ordering from Luxire. The customer service (I corresponded with Seema) is prompt, detail-oriented, and helpful. I ordered a custom pair of corduroy high-waisted trousers and the quality and fit is exceptional. No other retailer allows for so much customization without exorbitant costs! I will definitely be ordering more from them.',\n",
       " 'Very poor experience. I ordered a pair of pants that were made very far off from the measurements promised. Luxire did not admit any fault and offered to \"remake\" the pants if I paid an additional $75. Absolutely the worst experience I have had and will not ever recommend them to anyone.',\n",
       " \"I'm a Luxire customer since 2013. Luxire provide my favourite shirts and trousers in consistent quality at an unbeatable price. On top of that we have undertaken many special orders together like a two-piece suit, tuxedo, leather office bag, cableknit cardigan, overcoat and much more, that turned out fantastic.I can recommend anyone to start with a trial shirt / trousers or send in a garment for replication. Anyways, you can't go wrong with any of their options as long as you precisely specify every detail from your imagination.Whereas turnaround time has been slow in the early years, these days all my orders arrive in Germany within 1-2 weeks which is insane for custom clothing.Even my girlfriend has started ordering her shirts at Luxire and she is going to try trousers soon too.\",\n",
       " 'I have now ordered several shirts and pairs of trousers from Luxire. The lead time is very short, and the garments themselves have all been of a very high quality. The Luxire staff with whom I have spoken have also been very attentive and helpful. I have no hesitation in recommending Luxire wholeheartedly.',\n",
       " 'Luxire is a truly amazing company! I was recently in search of a custom pair of denim jeans and was able to pick everything I wanted and upload my measurements to luxires website. The pants shipped in 3 days, arrived 7 days later and fit perfectly. I highly recommend them. Definitely make sure if you submit your own measurements that you do them right.',\n",
       " 'I’ve been a Luxire customer for several years. Fabrics, craftsmanship and prices are great. I have previously had some communication issues but that has been very much improved. It may take a couple of iterations to nail the fit, but with these prices you can’t complain. They are also very helpful with giving fit adjustments based on pictures of previous orders. I’ve tried more expensive MTM services with in person fittings but they cannot compete with Luxire in terms of price and delivery times.',\n",
       " 'Firstly, the Solbiati stone grey linen is a great fabric.The design of the trousers was based on the Armani shape of the early \\'80s, looser, with a \"round leg\" shape, which was driven by the style of the pleat.Rather than the traditional forward / backward 1 or 2 pleats, this was a box pleat, as you might find on the back of a shirt.I sent a series of emails explaining what I wanted, together with pictures primarily from old Armani ad campaigns. I am pleased to say that Luxire produced a very good copy of an unusual design. One I doubt any of them had seen before',\n",
       " 'Great website and customer service. Very speedy manufacturing and delivery. I have ordered several pants and am very satisfied: high quality fabrics and near perfect fit (which for me is almost unheard of). I’m definitely going to order from Luxire again!',\n",
       " 'Luxire has once again been the best service I’ve used. They are quick, knowledgeable and dedicated to helping you achieve the exact fit and look you seek. I’ve now ordered five pants from Luxire for my wardrobe and loved every interaction along every step of the way. They are one of the best companies I’ve had to pleasure to work with and see who I plan to outfit the remainder of my trousers for fall/winter with. Even when mistakes occurred due to my own miscommunication they were happy to correct the issue and promptly set to making sure everything was correct.',\n",
       " \"My first order with Luxire-a pair of trousers in VBC flannel.   From reading online reviews, I half expected to have trousers travel backwards and forwards halfway round the world before the fit was right. No, the fit was great. I used their online guide, measured two pairs I have that fit well and hey presto great fitting new pair. Now here's the fantastic bit...delivered in around a week!! Comms was great throughout-I had some specific requests, rapid response and the guys did as they said they would.  Would not hesitate at all to order from Luxire again.\",\n",
       " 'Fantastic made-to-measure service. Ordered a custom pair of navy linen trousers that was made and delivered within a week (to the Netherlands). Lots of customisation options. Unfortunately, my submitted measurements were slightly off so Seema from customer service kindly offered me a discounted remake. Great customer service that takes care of you and makes sure you get the best experience, both in terms of communication and fit. Can also highly recommend the high-waisted ready-to-wear trousers that have a classic fit, opposed to the slim-fit trousers that you find on high street.',\n",
       " 'The whole process was great and the communication was very smooth over the email. The product turned out even better than I expected. The only negative thing was the extra charges, about 100 USD, I had to pay upon delivery, for the import in to the EU.']"
